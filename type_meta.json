                "content": "Introduction\n\nWHO IS AN ARCHITECT (INTJ)?\n\nAn Architect (INTJ) is a person with the Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging personality traits. These thoughtful tacticians love perfecting the details of life, applying creativity and rationality to everything they do. Their inner world is often a private, complex one.\n\n\u201cThought constitutes the greatness of man. Man is a reed, the feeblest thing in nature, but he is a thinking reed.\u201d\n\nBLAISE PASCAL\n\nIt can be lonely at the top. As one of the rarest personality types \u2013 and one of the most capable \u2013 Architects (INTJs) know this all too well. Rational and quick-witted, Architects may struggle to find people who can keep up with their nonstop analysis of everything around them.\n\nA Thirst for Knowledge\n\nThese personalities can be both the boldest of dreamers and the bitterest of pessimists. Architects believe that, through willpower and intelligence, they can achieve even the most challenging of goals. But they may be cynical about human nature more generally, assuming that most people are lazy, unimaginative, or simply doomed to mediocrity.\n\nArchitects derive much of their self-esteem from their knowledge and mental acuity. In school, people with this personality type may have been called \u201cbookworms\u201d or \u201cnerds.\u201d But rather than taking these labels as insults, many Architects embrace them. They are confident in their ability to teach themselves about \u2013 and master \u2013 any topic that interests them, whether that\u2019s coding or capoeira or classical music.\n\n\u201cYou are not entitled to your opinion. You are entitled to your informed opinion. No one is entitled to be ignorant.\u201d\n\nHARLAN ELLISON\n\nArchitects can be single-minded, with little patience for frivolity, distractions, or idle gossip. That said, it would be a mistake to stereotype these personalities as dull or humorless. Many Architects are known for their irreverent wit, and beneath their serious exteriors, they often have a sharp, delightfully sarcastic sense of humor.\n\nFinding a Better Way\n\nArchitects question everything. Many personality types trust the status quo, relying on conventional wisdom and other people\u2019s expertise as they go about their lives. But ever-skeptical Architects prefer to make their own discoveries. In their quest to find better ways of doing things, they aren\u2019t afraid to break the rules or risk disapproval \u2013 in fact, they rather enjoy it.\n\nBut as anyone with this personality type would tell you, a new idea isn\u2019t worth anything unless it actually works. Architects want to be successful, not just inventive. They bring a single-minded drive to their passion projects, applying the full force of their insight, logic, and willpower. And heaven help anyone who tries to slow them down by enforcing pointless rules or offering poorly thought-out criticism.\n\nArchitects, independent to the core, want to shake off other people\u2019s expectations and pursue their own ideas.\n\nThis personality type comes with a strong independent streak. Architects don\u2019t mind acting alone, perhaps because they don\u2019t like waiting around for others to catch up with them. They also generally feel comfortable making decisions without asking for anyone else\u2019s input. At times, this lone-wolf behavior can come across as insensitive, as it fails to take into consideration other people\u2019s thoughts, desires, and plans.\n\nSocial Frustrations\n\nArchitects aren\u2019t known for being warm and fuzzy. They tend to prioritize rationality and success over politeness and pleasantries \u2013 in other words, they\u2019d rather be right than popular. This may explain why so many fictional villains are modeled on this personality type.\n\nBecause Architects value truth and depth, many common social practices \u2013 from small talk to white lies \u2013 may seem pointless or downright stupid to them. As a result, they may inadvertently come across as rude or even offensive when they\u2019re only trying to be honest. At times, Architects may wonder if dealing with other people is even worth the frustration.\n\nBut like any personality type, Architects do crave social interaction \u2013 they\u2019d just prefer to surround themselves with people who share their values and priorities. Often, they can achieve this just by being themselves. When Architects pursue their interests, their natural confidence can draw people to them \u2013 professionally, socially, and even romantically.\n\nThe Chess Game of Life\n\nThis personality type is full of contradictions. Architects are imaginative yet decisive, ambitious yet private, and curious yet focused. From the outside, these contradictions may seem baffling, but they make perfect sense once you understand the inner workings of the Architect mind.\n\nFor Architects, life is like a giant game of chess. Relying on strategy rather than chance, they contemplate the strengths and weaknesses of each move before they make it. And they never lose faith that, with enough ingenuity and insight, they can find a way to win \u2013 no matter what challenges might arise along the way.\n\n01",

                "content": "Strengths & Weaknesses\nArchitect (INTJ) Strengths\nRational \u2013 Architects pride themselves on their minds. For them, nearly any situation can become an opportunity to expand their knowledge and hone their rational thinking skills. Thanks to this mindset, they can devise inventive solutions to even the most arduous of problems.\nInformed \u2013 Few personality types are as devoted as Architects to forming rational, evidence-based opinions. Rather than hunches or half-baked assumptions, they base their conclusions on research and analysis. This gives them the self-assurance they need to stand up for their ideas, even in the face of disagreement.\nIndependent \u2013 For these personality types, conformity is more or less synonymous with mediocrity. Creative and self-motivated, Architects strive to do things their own way. They can imagine few things more frustrating than allowing rules or conventions to stand in the way of their success.\nDetermined \u2013 Architect personalities are ambitious and goal-oriented. Whenever an idea or pursuit captures their imagination, Architects dedicate themselves to mastering the subject and gaining relevant skills. They tend to have clear visions of what it means for them to be successful, and few things can deter them from turning these visions into reality.\nCurious \u2013 Architects are open to new ideas \u2013 as long as those ideas are rational and evidence-based, that is. Skeptical by nature, these personality types are especially drawn to offbeat or contrarian points of view. They\u2019re even open to changing their own opinions when the facts prove them wrong.\nVersatile \u2013 Architects love diving into all sorts of challenges. Their curiosity and determination can help people with this personality type succeed in a wide range of endeavors.\nArchitect (INTJ) Weaknesses\nArrogant \u2013 Architects might be knowledgeable, but they\u2019re not infallible. Their self-assurance can blind them to useful input from other people \u2013 especially anyone they deem to be intellectually inferior. These personalities can also become needlessly harsh or single-minded in trying to prove others wrong.\nDismissive of Emotions \u2013 For Architects, rationality is king. But emotional context often matters more than people with this personality type care to admit. Architects can get impatient with anyone who seems to value feelings more than facts. Unfortunately, ignoring emotion is its own type of bias \u2013 one that can cloud Architects\u2019 judgment.\nOverly Critical \u2013 These personalities tend to have a great deal of self-control, particularly when it comes to thoughts and feelings. When the people in their lives fail to match their level of restraint, Architects can become scathingly critical. But this criticism is often unfair, based on arbitrary standards rather than a full understanding of human nature.\nCombative \u2013 Architects hate blindly following anything without understanding why. This includes restrictions and the authority figures who impose them. People with this personality type can get caught up in arguing about useless rules and regulations \u2013 but sometimes these battles are distractions from more important matters.\nRomantically Clueless \u2013 Architects\u2019 relentless rationality can lead them to be frustrated by romance. Especially in the early stages of a relationship, they may struggle to understand what\u2019s going on and how to behave. And if their relationships fall apart for reasons they don\u2019t understand, they can become cynical about matters of the heart, even questioning the importance of love and connection.\n02"

                "content": "Romantic Relationships\n\n\u201cOf all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness.\u201d\n\nBERTRAND RUSSELL\n\nPeople with the Architect (INTJ) personality type approach romance the way they do most challenges: strategically, with clear-cut goals and a plan for reaching them. In a purely rational world, this approach would be foolproof. Alas, it ignores important factors that Architects sometimes dismiss \u2013 such as the unpredictability of human nature and affection.\n\nFor these personalities, finding a compatible partner can be a particular challenge. Rarely satisfied with things as they are, Architects are always developing a world in their minds that is more perfect than reality. Other people entering their world need to fit this fantasy in some way. But if Architects\u2019 expectations and ideals for a partner are unrealistic, then no real person will be able to fulfill them in every way.\n\nThe Rites of Dating\n\nArchitects care about depth and intelligence, and they insist on honest, open communication. For them, a relationship that isn\u2019t founded on these values is hardly worth pursuing.\n\nIt might not come as a surprise, then, that the social niceties and obscure etiquette of dating can seem useless or even insulting to Architect personality types. But many of these conventions exist for a reason \u2013 to help an inherently unpredictable situation seem a little less daunting. If Architects refuse to play along, they may find the dating world difficult, if not impossible.\n\nAs Architects often learn, the ways of love are hard to describe in a spreadsheet.\n\nAs they mature and gain experience, many Architects eventually come to understand the purpose of romantic rituals. Until that point, however, they may decide that dating is too irrational or beneath them. Some people with this personality type might constantly try to demonstrate their intellectual superiority, as a way of proving that they\u2019re above the \u201csilliness\u201d of dating. Obviously, this mindset is unlikely to help Architects find or connect with a partner.\n\nSometimes, Architects\u2019 best strategy is to focus on what they enjoy rather than struggle against the rules of dating. Ironically, people with this personality type are often most attractive when they aren\u2019t trying to be. Just doing what they do best \u2013 pursuing the interests that light them up \u2013 can help their confidence and intelligence shine.\n\nEmotion Sickness\n\nArchitect personalities aren\u2019t known for conventional shows of romance, such as sending flowers or writing mushy notes. Most Architects spend more time thinking about love than expressing it. But when they believe that a relationship has potential, Architects can give it their all, working to maintain stability and ensure their partner\u2019s long-term satisfaction. And by using their imagination, people with this personality type can find meaningful, if unexpected, ways to share their affection.\n\nArchitects seek strong, meaningful relationships. They use their knowledge and logic to help ensure that their partner is satisfied.\n\nThat said, emotions may still feel like a second language to these personalities. Rather than getting to the core of their relationship conflicts, Architects might treat them as puzzles to be solved \u2013 an approach that isn\u2019t always successful. And when their partner shares strong feelings, Architects might shut down, or they may be tempted to analyze the situation rather than simply listening and offering support. For Architects, becoming comfortable with their partner\u2019s emotions \u2013 and their own \u2013 can take more than a little practice.\n\nLove is rarely easy, but it\u2019s a challenge that can help Architects grow. Through their relationships, Architects can learn to focus on the present, get in touch with their emotions, remain involved with other people, and stay open to things they\u2019re not used to. For a personality type so intent on self-development, these opportunities can make love even more satisfying.\n\n03"

                "content": "Friendships\n\n\u201cA friend to all is a friend to none.\u201d\n\nARISTOTLE\n\nSharp-witted and darkly funny, Architects (INTJs) aren\u2019t everyone\u2019s cup of tea \u2013 and they\u2019re okay with that. For the most part, people with this personality type aren\u2019t obsessed with being popular. They don\u2019t spend their time and energy on just anyone, and they can be difficult to get to know.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t mean that Architects are antisocial or friendless. In fact, few things are more exhilarating to Architect personalities than the spark they feel when they connect with someone who really gets them.\n\nThe Search for an Equal\n\nArchitects tend to have strong opinions about what works, what doesn\u2019t, what they\u2019re looking for, and what they\u2019re not. This mindset gives them a clear picture of what they expect from their social lives and their friends \u2013 and it can also lead them to reject anyone who doesn\u2019t seem to meet these expectations. From the outside, people with this personality type may seem dismissive, but they would say they\u2019re just being decisive.\n\nIn friendship, Architects are looking for an intellectual equal as much as anything else. These personalities crave mental stimulation, and they can become bored by anyone who can\u2019t keep up with the workings of their minds. Architects need to share their expansive ideas \u2013 making small talk is something they typically avoid.\n\nArchitects care about depth and quality. They\u2019d rather have just a few good friends than a large circle of acquaintances.\n\nIn their friendships, as in other aspects of their lives, Architects prize independence. Social obligations can feel stifling to people with this personality type. Architects don\u2019t want to feel beholden to their friends, and they don\u2019t want their friends to feel beholden to them. For them, an ideal friendship is low drama, based on mutual respect rather than obligation.\n\nOf course, any friendship will have its dramatic moments. When sensitive or emotional situations arise, Architects may feel out of their depth. Even with their closest friends, these personalities may struggle to offer comfort \u2013 or receive it. Architects are used to feeling knowledgeable and capable, and this sudden cluelessness can be disorienting for them.\n\nA Unique Friendship\n\nIt\u2019s not always easy to befriend an Architect. People with this personality type have little patience for social rules. Instead, they look for friends who value intellect, honesty, and self-improvement. They may become bored or irritated by anyone who falls short of this mark. Fortunately, anyone who does share these qualities is likely to appreciate Architects as well.\n\nAmong friends whom they know and respect, Architects have no trouble relaxing and being themselves. Their sarcasm and witty banter may not be for everyone \u2013 especially people who struggle to read between the lines. But Architects reward their true friends with candor and insight, along with an endless supply of fascinating stories, ideas, and conversations.\n\n04"

Parenting may not come easily to these personalities, requiring them to master new skills and increase their cognitive flexibility. Fortunately, Architects are pretty much always up for a challenge. And for Architects who choose to have children, few challenges may be as meaningful as parenthood.\n\nAn Honest Connection\n\nArchitects want their children to grow up to be capable and self-reliant, with clear interests and strong critical-thinking skills. Rather than enforce pointless rules, they look for age-appropriate ways to foster their child\u2019s independence. That\u2019s not to say that parents with this personality type are lenient \u2013 far from it. They expect their children to use their freedom responsibly.\n\nSome personality types might shelter their children from difficult subjects, but Architect parents typically believe that knowledge is far better than ignorance. For them, candor is a way of showing respect, and shielding their children from reality would be a disservice. Of course, the success of this approach depends on Architects\u2019 ability to correctly gauge their children\u2019s readiness for these hard truths.\n\nThe Chaos of Emotions\n\nCompared to other personality types, Architects aren\u2019t especially comfortable with displays of affection. Showering someone with love, praise, and affection can feel unnatural to them \u2013 even if that \u201csomeone\u201d is their own child. But children need cuddling and other expressions of love, particularly during their younger years. As a result, Architect parents may need to expand their emotional comfort zone in order to show their children how much they are loved.\n\nAnother challenge for parents with this personality type is offering emotional support. Architects take pride in being in command of their feelings, and they might expect their children to be able to do the same. But this expectation isn\u2019t reasonable \u2013 emotions may be confusing and, at times, chaotic, but they\u2019re perfectly normal, and children need validation and support in order to navigate them.\n\nArchitects are at their best when they can develop a plan to solve a problem\u2019s root cause. But sometimes the best solution to a kid\u2019s problem is just sitting with them as they explore their feelings.\nPreparing for Life\u2019s Challenges\n\nArchitects try to make sure that their children are prepared to deal with anything that life throws at them. Parents with this personality type can reframe problems as opportunities for personal growth, inspiring their children to develop their own style of rational thinking and problem-solving. Over time, Architects\u2019 children can apply these skills to increasingly complex situations, building their confidence as they grow.\n\nEvery parent has a different dream for their child\u2019s future. For Architects, the dream is to raise a competent adult who knows their own mind and solves their own problems \u2013 and, if the time comes, helps their own children do the same. Architects understand that this can\u2019t happen if they protect their children from every difficult or unpleasant thing in life. But their hope is that, if they give their children the right tools, they won\u2019t have to.\n\n05"

But these personalities won\u2019t settle for just any career. They want to tackle meaningful challenges and find elegant solutions to important problems, not just tinker with figures in a spreadsheet.\n\nArchitects also want the freedom to exercise their greatest strengths. Few personality types, if any, can match their ability to transform complex principles into clear and actionable strategies. Architects know how much they have to offer in their professional lives \u2013 and for them, any job that fails to draw on their skills and knowledge is a wasted opportunity.\n\nThe Early-Career Blues\n\nStarting out at the bottom of the career ladder can be frustrating for Architects. Early in their professional lives, they may be saddled with easy, routine tasks that bore them half to death. People with this personality type brim with creative, out-of-the-box ideas. But with their disdain for schmoozing and workplace politics, they may struggle to earn the favor of their bosses and colleagues.\n\nThe good news is that, over time, Architects can develop their abilities into a track record so effective that it can\u2019t be ignored. Even when the people around them fall prey to groupthink, Architect personalities can cut through the noise and figure out the true cause of a problem \u2013 and then fix it. Their competence gives them an advantage. As long as they don\u2019t alienate their coworkers, Architects can advance in their careers and gain the independence they need to see their ideas through.\n\nFinding Their Place\n\nSome personality types are drawn to jobs that require nonstop teamwork and interaction, but Architects tend to prefer lone-wolf positions. By working alone or in small groups, they can make the most of their creativity without constant interruptions from curious coworkers or second-guessing supervisors. Architects really do believe that if you want something done right, you\u2019d better do it yourself.\n\nThe other side of that coin is that Architects have little respect for anyone who gets ahead based on networking or nepotism rather than merit. People with this personality type value resourcefulness, grit, insight, and commitment \u2013 in themselves and in others. They believe that everyone should get their work done to the highest possible standards. So if a social butterfly at work breezes through without carrying their own weight, Architects may feel called to use their ingenuity to bring that person back down to earth.\n\nEver Greater Challenges\n\nArchitect personality types demand progress and evolution, and they love to explore new ideas. As their careers progress, they may be drawn to positions that allow them to influence a company or organization\u2019s overall strategies. Many Architects pursue low-profile but influential roles as project managers, systems engineers, marketing strategists, systems analysts, and military strategists.\n\nArchitects view a combination of intelligent approaches and hard work as the road to excellence.\n\nThe truth is that Architects can excel in just about any role. Some careers with strong social components, such as sales or human resources, might not seem like obvious fits \u2013 but fortunately, Architects know how to look beyond the obvious. These personalities have the creativity and vision to make important contributions in any workplace, and these skills certainly give them a leg up if they choose to start their own business.\n\n06"

And if any personality type has high standards for themselves, it\u2019s almost certainly Architects.\n\nIn theory, this attitude makes for a model employee and coworker. And in many ways, Architects are exactly that. But some personality types may find it a challenge to work with Architects. Architects may be harsh or dismissive toward people they don\u2019t respect \u2013 and unfortunately, losing their respect can be all too easy. In particular, they have little time for coworkers who prioritize convenience over innovation or socializing over success.\n\nArchitect Subordinates\n\nArchitects are known for their independence. Even in entry-level jobs, they may chafe at anyone who tries to limit their freedom. Their worst nightmare would be a micromanaging boss who monopolizes their time with pointless meetings, insists on useless rules, and appraises employees\u2019 performance based on how likable they seem rather than their actual merits.\n\nTitles mean little to Architects, and they often struggle to defer to a manager they don\u2019t respect. They might also find it difficult to restrain themselves from offering their bosses feedback and criticism \u2013 an approach that, depending on the boss, can backfire.\n\nIn the real world, not all bosses will be as logical or open-minded as Architects might prefer. But that doesn\u2019t mean that people with this personality type should allow a less-than-ideal manager to hold them back.\n\nArchitects may need to use all of their creativity and ingenuity to expand their responsibilities and develop their expertise \u2013 even if they don\u2019t have the independence they crave. To do this, they may need to prioritize building a productive and respectful relationship with their manager, no matter how far from perfect that person may be.\n\nArchitect Colleagues\n\nFew Architects choose jobs that require constant teamwork or social interaction. To these personalities, most team-building techniques and group meetings are a waste of time. And chitchat, gossip, and office politics \u2013 well, those can be nothing short of workplace plagues.\n\nMany Architects would rather work alone than be slowed down by anyone who isn\u2019t as focused as they are. Fortunately, their perfectionism and resolve often enable them to produce effective results even without the help of others.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that Architects can\u2019t work with others \u2013 in fact, they may achieve some of their greatest successes this way. Their capability and reliability can make them excellent collaborators. People with this personality type may never enjoy pairing up with coworkers who get hung up on the wrong details or can\u2019t otherwise earn their respect. But in the company of a small group of trusted colleagues, Architects\u2019 brainstorming sessions may become even more electric.\n\nArchitect Managers\n\nThough they may be surprised to hear it, Architects can make great leaders. In the workplace, they rarely throw around their authority just to prove that they\u2019re in charge. Instead, they look for ways to promote innovation and effectiveness \u2013 even if that means breaking with established hierarchies. Some managers might enjoy being pandered to, but Architect personalities would rather be successful than constantly validated.\n\nGenerally speaking, Architects prefer to treat those who work for them as equals. Rather than micromanaging, they aim to direct broader strategies while letting other people handle day-to-day activities. That\u2019s not to say that they\u2019re completely hands-off, however. Architect bosses want to know exactly what\u2019s going on and when, and they're always ready to drill into any level of detail necessary.\n\nThese managers respect and reward proactive behavior, delegating responsibilities to employees with the strongest critical-thinking skills. But this freedom isn\u2019t just granted \u2013 it\u2019s required. Employees who struggle to direct themselves \u2013 who just want to be told what to do \u2013 may have a hard time meeting Architects\u2019 standards. And anyone who tries to cover up bad results with flattery or excuses is likely to be disappointed. Those strategies rarely work with Architect personalities.\n\n07"

                "content": "Introduction\n\nWHO IS A LOGICIAN (INTP)?\n\nA Logician (INTP) is someone with the Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits. These flexible thinkers enjoy taking an unconventional approach to many aspects of life. They often seek out unlikely paths, mixing willingness to experiment with personal creativity.\n\nLearn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is not to stop questioning.\n\nALBERT EINSTEIN\n\nThe Logician personality type is fairly rare, making up only three percent of the population, which is definitely a good thing for them, as there\u2019s nothing they\u2019d be more unhappy about than being \u201ccommon\u201d. Logicians pride themselves on their inventiveness and creativity, their unique perspective and vigorous intellect. Usually known as the philosopher, the architect, or the dreamy professor, Logicians have been responsible for many scientific discoveries throughout history.\n\nThe Unexamined Life Is Not Worth Living\nLogicians are known for their brilliant theories and unrelenting logic \u2013 in fact, they are considered the most logically precise of all the personality types.\n\nThey love patterns, and spotting discrepancies between statements could almost be described as a hobby, making it a bad idea to lie to a Logician. This makes it ironic that Logicians\u2019 word should always be taken with a grain of salt \u2013 it\u2019s not that they are dishonest, but people with the Logician personality type tend to share thoughts that are not fully developed, using others as a sounding board for ideas and theories in a debate against themselves rather than as actual conversation partners.\n\nThis may make them appear unreliable, but in reality no one is more enthusiastic and capable of spotting a problem, drilling through the endless factors and details that encompass the issue and developing a unique and viable solution than Logicians \u2013 just don\u2019t expect punctual progress reports. People who share the Logician personality type aren\u2019t interested in practical, day-to-day activities and maintenance, but when they find an environment where their creative genius and potential can be expressed, there is no limit to the time and energy Logicians will expend in developing an insightful and unbiased solution.\n\nWisdom Begins in Wonder\n\nThey may appear to drift about in an unending daydream, but Logicians\u2019 thought process is unceasing, and their minds buzz with ideas from the moment they wake up. This constant thinking can have the effect of making them look pensive and detached, as they are often conducting full-fledged debates in their own heads, but really Logicians are quite relaxed and friendly when they are with people they know, or who share their interests. However, this can be replaced by overwhelming shyness when Logician personalities are among unfamiliar faces, and friendly banter can quickly become combative if they believe their logical conclusions or theories are being criticized.\n\nWhen Logicians are particularly excited, the conversation can border on incoherence as they try to explain the daisy-chain of logical conclusions that led to the formation of their latest idea. Oftentimes, Logicians will opt to simply move on from a topic before it\u2019s ever understood what they were trying to say, rather than try to lay things out in plain terms.\n\nThe reverse can also be true when people explain their thought processes to Logicians in terms of subjectivity and feeling. Imagine an immensely complicated clockwork, taking in every fact and idea possible, processing them with a heavy dose of creative reasoning and returning the most logically sound results available \u2013 this is how the Logician mind works, and this type has little tolerance for an emotional monkey-wrench jamming their machines.\n\nLet Those Who Would Move the World First Move Themselves\n\nFurther, Logicians are unlikely to understand emotional complaints at all, and their friends won\u2019t find a bedrock of emotional support in them. People with the Logician personality type would much rather make a series of logical suggestions for how to resolve the underlying issue, a perspective that is not always welcomed by their more sensitive companions. This will likely extend to most social conventions and goals as well, like planning dinners and getting married, as Logicians are far more concerned with originality and efficient results.\n\nThe one thing that really holds Logicians back is their restless and pervasive fear of failure. Logician personalities are so prone to reassessing their own thoughts and theories, worrying that they\u2019ve missed some critical piece of the puzzle, that they can stagnate, lost in an intangible world where their thoughts are never truly applied. Overcoming this self-doubt stands as the greatest challenge Logicians are likely to face, but the intellectual gifts \u2013 big and small \u2013 bestowed on the world when they do makes it worth the fight.\n\n01",

                "content": "Strengths & Weaknesses\nLogician Strengths\nGreat Analysts and Abstract Thinkers \u2013 People with the Logician personality type view the world as a big, complex machine, and recognize that as with any machine, all parts are interrelated. Logicians excel in analyzing these connections, seeing how seemingly unrelated factors tie in with each other in ways that bewilder most other personality types.\nImaginative and Original \u2013 These connections are the product of an unrelenting imagination \u2013 Logicians\u2019 ideas may seem counter-intuitive at a glance, and may never even see the light of day, but they will always prove remarkable innovations.\nOpen-Minded \u2013 Logicians couldn\u2019t make these connections if they thought they knew it all \u2013 they are highly receptive to alternate theories, so long as they\u2019re supported by logic and facts. In more subjective matters like social norms and traditions, Logicians are usually fairly liberal, with a \u201cnone of my business\u201d sort of attitude \u2013 peoples\u2019 ideas are what matter.\nEnthusiastic \u2013 When a new idea piques their interest, Logicians can be very enthusiastic \u2013 they are a reserved personality type, but if another person shares an interest, they can be downright excited about discussing it. More likely though, the only outward evidence of this enthusiasm will be Logicians\u2019 silent pacing or their staring into the distance.\nObjective \u2013 Logicians\u2019 analysis, creativity and open-mindedness aren\u2019t the tools of some quest for ideology or emotional validation. Rather, it\u2019s as though people with the Logician personality type are a conduit for the truths around them, so far as they can be expressed, and they are proud of this role as theoretical mediator.\nHonest and Straightforward \u2013 To know one thing and say another would be terribly disingenuous \u2013 Logicians don\u2019t often go around intentionally hurting feelings, but they believe that the truth is the most important factor, and they expect that to be appreciated and reciprocated.\nLogician Weaknesses\nVery Private and Withdrawn \u2013 While Logicians\u2019 intellectualism yields many insights into their surroundings, their surroundings are ironically considered an intrusion on their thoughts. This is especially true with people \u2013 Logicians are quite shy in social settings. More complicated situations such as parties exacerbate this, but even close friends struggle to get into Logicians\u2019 hearts and minds.\nInsensitive \u2013 Oftentimes Logician personalities get so caught up in their logic that they forget any kind of emotional consideration \u2013 they dismiss subjectivity as irrational and tradition as an attempt to bar much-needed progress. Purely emotional situations are often utterly puzzling to Logicians, and their lack of timely sympathy can easily offend.\nAbsent-minded \u2013 When Logicians\u2019 interest is captured, their absence goes beyond social matters to include the rest of the physical world. Logicians become forgetful, missing even the obvious if it\u2019s unrelated to their current infatuation, and they can even forget their own health, skipping meals and sleep as they muse.\nCondescending \u2013 Attempts at connecting with others are often worse than Logicians\u2019 withdrawal. People with the Logician personality type take pride in their knowledge and rationale, and enjoy sharing their ideas, but in trying to explain how they got from A to B to Z, they can get frustrated, sometimes simplifying things to the point of insult as they struggle to gauge their conversation partners\u2019 perspective. The ultimate insult comes as Logicians give up with a dismissive \u201cnever mind\u201d.\nLoathe Rules and Guidelines \u2013 These social struggles are partly a product of Logicians\u2019 desire to bypass the rules, of social conduct and otherwise. While this attitude helps Logicians\u2019 strength of unconventional creativity, it also causes them to reinvent the wheel constantly and to shun security in favor of autonomy in ways that can compromise both.\nSecond-Guess Themselves \u2013 Logicians remain so open to new information that they often never commit to a decision at all. This applies to their own skills as well \u2013 Logician personalities know that as they practice, they improve, and any work they do is second-best to what they could do. Unable to settle for this, Logicians sometimes delay their output indefinitely with constant revisions, sometimes even quitting before they ever begin.\n02"

                "content": "Romantic Relationships\n\nWhen it comes to romantic relationships, Logicians have an interesting mixture of traits that often pleasantly surprise their partners. People with this personality type are always full of ideas, but they have few opportunities to explore their more romantic notions. As with any of their theories, Logicians love sharing with others, and in finally meeting someone where romantic thoughts are appropriate, they show themselves to be excited, enthusiastic, and even playful, flirting with word-play and intellectual games.\n\nNone of this is to say that these relationships come easily to Logicians \u2013 they are shy and withdrawn individuals, and getting out and meeting new people, risking rejection and making themselves the center of attention in emotionally delicate situations are far from being their strengths. It is more likely that Logician personalities will leave a trail of breadcrumbs for a potential partner, allowing them to make the first move and committing to their partner as an act of reciprocation rather than bravado.\n\nMarry! A Good Wife Makes Happiness, A Bad One, Philosophy\n\nFrom the start, Logicians take their relationships seriously \u2013 their imagination and vision, and the challenge of getting to know new people, make them all too aware of how important it is that they\u2019re involved with someone, and they will prove themselves surprisingly loyal. Even early in the dating phase, Logicians are unusually direct and honest, doing their best to express their mindset and create mutual understanding, believing that this shared knowledge will help to minimize misunderstandings and avoid conflict.\n\nAs their relationships progress, Logicians\u2019 daily needs prove remarkably simple. Gifts, surprises, complex social plans and date nights are all fairly unimportant to people with the Logician personality type, but this is also one of their chiefest weaknesses \u2013 their partner may very much need these things, and it won\u2019t even occur to Logicians to plan them out. For all their analysis and attempts at mutual understanding, Logicians are notoriously bad at picking up on others\u2019 emotional needs.\n\nWhen it comes to conflict, there is a certain willful ignorance for Logicians, and they often set aside their partners\u2019 feelings, and their own, for far too long.\n\nWhen these conflicts do arise and are inescapable, Logicians will do their best to find a logical solution. But this hardly helps if the problem is logic itself, that Logician personalities aren\u2019t meeting their partners\u2019 emotional needs. Logicians should keep this in mind, and try to meet their partners halfway by communicating on an emotional level \u2013 if they make this effort, understanding partners will recognize and appreciate the gesture, clumsy though it may be. After all, they need to afford Logicians the same benefit, and meet them halfway with logic and simplicity as well.\n\nBeware the Barrenness of a Busy Life\n\nAll this material asceticism and conflict avoidance support one primary goal \u2013 to free up mental resources for more important things. Logicians\u2019 creative, vivid imagination make for a surprisingly enthusiastic, passionate, and romantic partner. While Logicians may prioritize their inner world too much, imagining interesting and exciting intimate situations that are never expressed to their partners, they also use this rich inner world to achieve as much as possible in intimacy \u2013 they rarely want for ideas.\n\nPhysically, intellectually and with a little effort emotionally, Logician relationships are rich and rewarding connections. Partners who share the Intuitive (N) trait are usually best, along with one or two opposite traits to create variety and balance, but so long as Logicians remember that they are with people who have their own, independent wants and needs, and so long as their partners remember the same of their Logicians, these are long-lasting and satisfying relationships.\n\n03"

More likely, these concepts are met with disdain, as people with the Logician personality type prize intellectual depth above all else. It is not easy to become good friends with Logicians, but if there is a common interest and a common train of thought, the connection is likely to spark instantly, surprising everyone else who thought they had this distant personality type pegged.\n\nBe Slow to Fall Into Friendship...\n\nLogician friendships are knowledge-based, defined by the exchange of ideas, theories, and concepts, and those who aren\u2019t able to keep up with this, or who have sharply differing tastes (don\u2019t talk to Logicians about celebrities) will find stony faces that border on rude. To Logicians, communication is often more of a nuisance than a pleasure, and conversation is reserved for topics that they find meaningful, or for people they already like enough to stick it out.\n\nUnless there\u2019s a natural affinity for this intellectual style, few have the patience to try to penetrate their shields, and Logicians are left with a naturally small circle of good friends.\n\nOther Analyst personalities are a natural fit for Logicians, who share their passion for new ideas, riddles and solutions. People with the Logician personality type are knowledgeable and intelligent, and have a great deal of respect for those who can keep them on their toes in this regard. They will gladly help to tackle any dilemma thrown their way, offering up sound advice and rational solutions. As valuable as these qualities are though, they are not always the best approach \u2013 when it comes to emotional support or advice in dealing with matters of the heart, Logicians are at a loss.\n\nIt\u2019s not that Logician personalities don\u2019t feel \u2013 quite the contrary, they actually have very strong sentiments. But this is not their strongest suit, making Logicians\u2019 emotional reactions strong, untrustworthy and naturally in need of being tempered by their well-trained logic and rationalism.\n\n...But When in Friendship, Continue Firm and Constant\n\nWhile they may not be able to help directly with these sorts of problems, Logicians help indirectly with unambiguous and reliable friendships. Logicians\u2019 friends need never worry about power games or emotional baggage \u2013 they are liked for their minds and abilities, not their status or possessions. While it may not be easy to establish true friendships with Logician personalities, once the link is made, they will provide years of understanding and thought-stimulating ideas, making them well worth the effort.\n\n04"

Not a naturally sensitive type, Logician personalities struggle to identify with the raw emotions and irrationality that are often the standard with young children, who have yet to develop the sort of self-control and logical thinking that Logicians take for granted.\n\nPeople with the Logician personality type are nevertheless incredibly devoted \u2013 perhaps not in the traditional, emotionally supportive sense, but they are parents who are committed to encouraging their growing children to think and act independently, seek out new knowledge, and voice and defend their own opinions.\n\nFor Logicians, knowledge is key, and they will do their best to give their children the tolerance and freedom necessary to acquire it. Logician parents take a relaxed, intellectual approach towards their children, allowing them to explore the world around them and overlooking the more minor offences along the way.\n\nHaving no interest in exerting control over other human beings, Logicians are likely to allow their children to form their own principles \u2013 though they may take the opportunity of the \u201cwhy?\u201d phase to share their own perspectives and ideas, just in case.\n\nLogician personalities are not particularly demanding parents, at least not in the sense that they expect their children to live a traditional life of school > career > marriage > house > kids > retirement (and in that order, thank you very much). Rather, Logician parents are demanding in an intellectual sense \u2013 they want their children to ask if this path is the best path for them, and how to go about following a different one if they need to. This level of personal freedom can be daunting, and can take a long time to come to terms with, but Logician parents are prepared to stand by their children with support and advice for as long as they need.\n\nWhile there is hardly a better parent for having rational, intelligent discussions with their children, there is hardly a clumsier example when it comes to providing the emotional support that many children need, especially as they approach their teenage years. In this area, Logicians will need to either rely on a more capable partner, or to take themselves far out of their comfort zone in order to empathize without trying to clear away the tears with an endless series of rational suggestions and blunt truths.\n\nNot Just Life, but Good Life\n\nLogicians want nothing more than for their children to grow up smart, independent, and tolerant, but if they want them to be well-adjusted too, they must make this effort. Logicians\u2019 parenting style affords a great deal of latitude for their children, but with this freedom comes responsibility, and it is Logicians\u2019 responsibility to ensure that it is used constructively. Though it\u2019s a challenge for people with the Logician personality type to teach empathy alongside rationality, if they are able to pull it off, their children will grow into confident adults who know how to ask questions, use their minds, and take care of themselves no matter what comes their way.\n\n05"

Logicians duly struggle in finding careers that meet their needs, but what they do bring, qualities in much higher demand, are creativity, a passion for theoretical methods and ideas, and an entrepreneurial, innovative spirit. If they are able to put this better foot forward to secure a position in a suitable line of work, people with the Logician personality type will find that, whatever the job listing says, these \u201cless desirable\u201d qualities will prove an asset after all.\n\nA Poem of Numbers\n\nChief among Logicians\u2019 interests is exploring and building models for underlying principles and ideas, even going so far as to find these concepts, in their own way, beautiful \u2013 this makes them natural mathematicians, systems analysts, and career scientists, especially in more abstract fields such as physics. There are many other careers that allow Logicians to explore these interests, but many of them are far too rooted in uninteresting practical applications. As useful as it is to develop a better vacuum cleaner, it is no Large Hadron Collider.\n\nLogician personalities are self-driven and have very high personal standards \u2013 \u201cgood enough\u201d is never good enough \u2013 but have few environmental needs. Despite this relative simplicity, they are often hard for more people-centric types to understand. Logicians live primarily in their own heads, and have little interest in social distractions like chitchat and motivational speeches.\n\nAll Logicians really want is to immerse themselves in an interesting project, and anything that interrupts that, be it overactive managers, the need to manage others, or office parties or meetings, are simply unwelcome burdens.\n\nFor this reason, the flatter the workplace hierarchy, the better, making small, technical workplaces and fields such as law, forensics, and laboratory research very desirable for Logicians. Insightful and open-minded managers who can accommodate these needs will find their Logician subordinates to be a tireless generator of brilliant and unique ideas. However, many people with the Logician personality type may do away with the immediate hierarchy altogether, opting instead to provide their services on a freelance basis as consultants.\n\nEmotional Values: A Mere Illusion\n\nWhere Logicians do not thrive is in workplaces that require them to provide a high degree of emotional satisfaction \u2013 cruise ship masseuses they are not. Logician personalities struggle to understand emotional exchanges, and service-oriented positions will prove baffling and exhausting for them. Though Logicians are talented analysts who are perfectly capable of understanding the theoretical importance of customer service, the day-to-day application of such a scheme is simply better left to more people-oriented personality types.\n\nBusiness is growing more complex every day, and this complexity is managed with technical systems, economic theories, and data. The need for novel approaches is stronger than ever for people and organizations to distinguish themselves. Though general people skills are often phrased as a must, it is the technical work that creates something to talk about, and it is in this pursuit that Logicians thrive.\n\nWork as business analysts and corporate strategists is well suited to Logicians, but they can also move things forward as data analysts, mechanical, electrical and software engineers, and even as technical writers and journalists, provided the field is interesting enough. If they can smile and shake hands just long enough to establish themselves as the brilliant innovators that they are, people with the Logician personality type will find that whatever the expectations for social conduct, it is the qualities unique to them that are truly in demand.\n\n06"

Whether in subordinate or management positions, with colleagues or working alone, these privileges and the freedom to pursue them unfettered by social obligations and progress reports are about all people with the Logician personality type look for in their workplace.\n\nThough Logicians may scoff at the notion, they actually function best when paired with another person. Their position determines which personality type best fits their needs, but Logicians\u2019 tendency to live in their heads and vent inspiration and creativity seemingly at random demands the presence of an implementer to ensure that no stroke of genius goes unnoticed.\n\nLogician Subordinates\n\nUnder the right conditions, Logician subordinates are innovative, resourceful, and hard-working, easily wrapping their minds around whatever complex problems are placed in front of them and delivering unorthodox but effective solutions. However, these qualities require a great deal of freedom, something stereotypical managers are loath to cede. It is difficult to quantify these qualities on a resume \u2013 several other characteristics, like a relative indifference to job security and to being liked, exacerbate the challenge \u2013 and it can take time to grow to trust Logician subordinates enough to allow this latitude.\n\nLogician personalities prefer to work alone, but at the same time they despise \u201cgrunt-work\u201d. Their focus on conceiving new and exciting ideas and ignoring the details of execution means that Logicians need someone alongside to keep things in order and actually put into practice their often unrefined ideas. Such a condition can\u2019t be forced on Logicians, but a few logically phrased criticisms (certainly not emotional appeals or pep talks about working as part of a team) and clever management can make it happen.\n\nLogician Colleagues\n\nFor Logicians, colleagues aren\u2019t so much a group of people who they socialize and work with as they are a series of obstacles and diversions with occasionally useful knowledge. Mingling, chitchat, drinks after work \u2013 these make Logicians want to work alone, not get up in the morning. Despite this distance, people with the Logician personality type are unusually good at developing insightful and unbiased interpretations of others\u2019 motivations, though sometimes they overthink it, becoming unnecessarily suspicious of others\u2019 goals.\n\nWhat they do enjoy are riddles and patterns, and any Logician would be proud to be the guru who is sought after as arbiter on the validity of an idea, or for their insight on how to apply a principle to novel situations. Logicians love discussing theories, at least with \u201cproven\u201d colleagues, and are almost always available as impromptu consultants. This, however, does not apply to emotional riddles and conflicts, Logicians\u2019 Achilles Heel \u2013 in these charged situations, Logician personalities have no clue what to do.\n\nLogician Managers\n\nWhile Logicians don\u2019t care for managing other people, it is likely the most rewarding position as it provides the opportunity to direct concepts and theories while others handle the logistics. Logicians have a very tolerant and flexible style, characterized by an openness to logical suggestions and relative freedom for their subordinates. But this freedom comes at a cost \u2013 Logician managers have very high standards, and they expect others to grasp their insights instantly, and to provide their own in equal measure.\n\nAs well as their demand for innovation, Logicians are better than any other type at noticing logical discrepancies \u2013 their tendency to ignore others\u2019 feelings means that their criticisms often come hard and fast as they direct projects to their own perfectionistic standards. Here again Logicians do best with a partner, this time a delegator who can filter their thoughts and direct their team in more socially productive ways. A liaison can also help to deter schmoozing and attempts at emotional manipulation, a sure mistake for anyone who tries.\n\n07"

At the same time, their many quirks, such as often unconstrained rationalism, lead to many misunderstandings. Those misunderstandings end here.

You went from trademark Logician skepticism to \u201chuh...\u201d to \u201cwait, what?\u201d You may even be a little uncomfortable because you are really not used to being understood, even by the people you\u2019re closest to.\n\nChances are, you\u2019ve accepted that as part of who you are, and maybe even grown proud of it. But embracing that disconnection isn\u2019t a requirement for Logicians. It\u2019s a misused defense mechanism, leading you down a lonely, inefficient path \u2013 gaining insight into yourself and others is so much more rewarding.\n\nThis is no date-of-birth gimmick, and no, we did not spy on you \u2013 rather, we\u2019ve spent years studying Logicians\u2019 life stories, experiences, and patterns in hundreds of our surveys.

                "content": "Introduction\n\nWHO IS A COMMANDER (ENTJ)?\n\nA Commander (ENTJ) is someone with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging personality traits. They are decisive people who love momentum and accomplishment. They gather information to construct their creative visions but rarely hesitate for long before acting on them.\n\nYour time is limited, so don\u2019t waste it living someone else\u2019s life. Don\u2019t be trapped by dogma \u2014 which is living with the results of other people\u2019s thinking. Don\u2019t let the noise of others\u2019 opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.\n\nSTEVE JOBS\n\nCommanders are natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence, and project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. However, Commanders are also characterized by an often ruthless level of rationality, using their drive, determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end they\u2019ve set for themselves. Perhaps it is best that they make up only three percent of the population, lest they overwhelm the more timid and sensitive personality types that make up much of the rest of the world \u2013 but we have Commanders to thank for many of the businesses and institutions we take for granted every day.\n\nHappiness Lies in the Joy of Achievement\n\nIf there\u2019s anything Commanders love, it\u2019s a good challenge, big or small, and they firmly believe that given enough time and resources, they can achieve any goal. This quality makes people with the Commander personality type brilliant entrepreneurs, and their ability to think strategically and hold a long-term focus while executing each step of their plans with determination and precision makes them powerful business leaders. This determination is often a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Commanders push their goals through with sheer willpower where others might give up and move on, and their Extraverted (E) nature means they are likely to push everyone else right along with them, achieving spectacular results in the process.\n\nAt the negotiating table, be it in a corporate environment or buying a car, Commanders are dominant, relentless, and unforgiving. This isn\u2019t because they are coldhearted or vicious per se \u2013 it\u2019s more that Commander personalities genuinely enjoy the challenge, the battle of wits, the repartee that comes from this environment, and if the other side can\u2019t keep up, that\u2019s no reason for Commanders to fold on their own core tenet of ultimate victory.\n\nThe underlying thought running through the Commander mind might be something like \"I don\u2019t care if you call me an insensitive b*****d, as long as I remain an efficient b*****d\".\n\nIf there\u2019s anyone Commanders respect, it\u2019s someone who is able to stand up to them intellectually, who is able to act with a precision and quality equal to their own. Commander personalities have a particular skill in recognizing the talents of others, and this helps in both their team-building efforts (since no one, no matter how brilliant, can do everything alone), and to keep Commanders from displaying too much arrogance and condescension. However, they also have a particular skill in calling out others\u2019 failures with a chilling degree of insensitivity, and this is where Commanders really start to run into trouble.\n\nCultivating the Science of Human Relationships\n\nEmotional expression isn\u2019t the strong suit of any Analyst type, but Commanders\u2019 distance from their emotions is especially public, and felt directly by a much broader swath of people. Especially in a professional environment, Commanders will simply crush the sensitivities of those they view as inefficient, incompetent or lazy. To people with the Commander personality type, emotional displays are displays of weakness, and it\u2019s easy to make enemies with this approach \u2013 Commanders will do well to remember that they absolutely depend on having a functioning team, not just to achieve their goals, but for their validation and feedback as well, something Commanders are, curiously, very sensitive to.\n\nCommanders are true powerhouses, and they cultivate an image of being larger than life \u2013 and often enough they are. They need to remember though, that their stature comes not just from their own actions, but from the actions of the team that props them up, and that it\u2019s important to recognize the contributions, talents and needs, especially from an emotional perspective, of their support network. Even if they have to adopt a \"fake it \u2018til you make it\" mentality, if Commanders are able to combine an emotionally healthy focus alongside their many strengths, they will be rewarded with deep, satisfying relationships and all the challenging victories they can handle.\n\n01",

                "content": "Strengths & Weaknesses\nCommander Strengths\nEfficient \u2013 Commanders see inefficiency not just as a problem in its own right, but as something that pulls time and energy away from all their future goals, an elaborate sabotage consisting of irrationality and laziness. People with the Commander personality type will root out such behavior wherever they go.\nEnergetic \u2013 Rather than finding this process taxing Commanders are energized by it, genuinely enjoying leading their teams forward as they implement their plans and goals.\nSelf-Confident \u2013 Commanders couldn\u2019t do this if they were plagued by self-doubt \u2013 they trust their abilities, make known their opinions, and believe in their capacities as leaders.\nStrong-Willed \u2013 Nor do they give up when the going gets tough \u2013 Commander personalities strive to achieve their goals, but really nothing is quite as satisfying to them as rising to the challenge of each obstacle in their run to the finish line.\nStrategic Thinkers \u2013 Commanders exemplify the difference between moment-to-moment crisis management and navigating the challenges and steps of a bigger plan, and are known for examining every angle of a problem and not just resolving momentary issues, but moving the whole project forward with their solutions.\nCharismatic and Inspiring \u2013 These qualities combine to create individuals who are able to inspire and invigorate others, who people actually want to be their leaders, and this in turn helps Commanders to accomplish their often ambitious goals that could never be finished alone.\nCommander Weaknesses\nStubborn and Dominant \u2013 Sometimes all this confidence and willpower can go too far, and Commanders are all too capable of digging in their heels, trying to win every single debate and pushing their vision, and theirs alone.\nIntolerant \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s my way or the highway\u201d \u2013 People with the Commander personality type are notoriously unsupportive of any idea that distracts from their primary goals, and even more so of ideas based on emotional considerations. Commanders won\u2019t hesitate a second to make that fact clear to those around them.\nImpatient \u2013 Some people need more time to think than others, an intolerable delay to quick-thinking Commanders. They may misinterpret contemplation as stupidity or disinterest in their haste, a terrible mistake for a leader to make.\nArrogant \u2013 Commander personalities respect quick thoughts and firm convictions, their own qualities, and look down on those who don\u2019t match up. This relationship is a challenge for most other personality types who are perhaps not timid in their own right, but will seem so beside overbearing Commanders.\nPoor Handling of Emotions \u2013 All this bluster, alongside the assumed supremacy of rationalism, makes Commanders distant from their own emotional expression and sometimes downright scornful of others\u2019. People with this personality type often trample others\u2019 feelings, inadvertently hurting their partners and friends, especially in emotionally charged situations.\nCold and Ruthless \u2013 Their obsession with efficiency and unwavering belief in the merits of rationalism, especially professionally, makes Commanders incredibly insensitive in pursuing their goals, dismissing personal circumstances, sensitivities, and preferences as irrational and irrelevant.\n02"

                "content": "Romantic Relationships\n\nAs in other areas of their lives, Commanders approach dating and relationships with a set of goals and a plan to achieve them, and proceed to do so with impressive energy and enthusiasm. People with the Commander personality type are in it to win, and will gladly take leading roles in relationships from the start, assuming personal responsibility for how smoothly things go and working actively to ensure a mutually rewarding experience. Romantic relationships are a serious business, and Commanders are in it for the long haul.\n\nWe Cannot Succeed Unless, When We Choose, We Choose Wisely\n\nThis sense of personal responsibility means that Commanders put a lot of energy into their relationships, and they show their creativity by always having something new on the agenda to keep things interesting, especially in the dating phase. At the same time though, Commander personalities keep their eyes on the long term, and if they determine that a relationship is heading towards a dead end, they will cut their losses and move on in what will seem to their partner an abrupt end to the attention they had been receiving.\n\nThis occasional ruthlessness with personal relationships is Commanders\u2019 primary weakness, and if they aren\u2019t careful they can develop quite the reputation. Sensing others\u2019 feelings and emotions will never be a comfortable skill for Commanders, but it is critical that they work consciously to develop it, both for their partners\u2019 sake and for their own healthy emotional expression. If they don\u2019t, they risk dominating and overruling their partners, and this insensitivity can easily break a relationship, especially early on.\n\nConfidence Thrives on Unselfish Performance\n\nBut as all goes well in the dating phase and a future is deemed viable, people with the Commander personality type continue to impress with their creativity and energy. Their authentic confidence makes Commanders\u2019 sex life dynamic to say the least, and they often push to explore new ways to express their affection with imaginative enthusiasm. Yet Commanders tend to have these innovations planned in advance, with some structure and predictability to their sex lives, leaving the true spontaneity to those less organized personality types.\n\nCommanders are extremely growth-oriented, and will seize any opportunity to improve themselves, listening to and acting on criticisms, so long as they are logical ones, and always striving to improve their knowledge. At the same time, Commanders expect this of their partners, and it is surprising to them that others don\u2019t always share this attitude. Still more surprising to Commander personalities is others\u2019 active efforts to avoid these tense situations.\n\nCommanders in particular would do well to remember that their approach is just one angle of a multi-faceted spectrum of alternatives. While Commanders may view criticism as the most efficient route (and they\u2019re often right), they should bear in mind that their partners may be more interested in emotional support and growth, an area of self-improvement that Commanders themselves too often avoid.\n\nAs with most things, balance is key, and Commanders should strive to meet their partners half-way, whatever their needs, be it through honest criticisms or steady emotional support and praise.\n\nAs with other Analyst types, Commanders\u2019 best matches are with other Intuitive (N) types, with one or two opposing traits to create more balance in the relationship. Mature Commanders are able to recognize and adapt to the needs of their partners, and know that even the most rational individuals have emotional needs that must be met. Fortunately the same logic that dismisses emotions is also able to recognize that a conciliatory attitude can be the best tool to get the job done. With their strong senses of responsibility and dedication, people with the Commander personality type are sure to make this effort, resulting in long-lasting, satisfying relationships.\n\n03"

Friendships of circumstance, built on things like shared routines, are not Commanders\u2019 preferred method \u2013 rather, they pursue their friends, seek out individuals who share their passion for deep, meaningful discussions, and who enjoy learning and development as much as they do. It is not always easy to be Commanders\u2019 friends \u2013 they demand a lot from these relationships \u2013 but they pay a great deal of attention to their friendships, and it is unlikely that it will ever feel stagnant.\n\nCommander friendships are built on ideas, and a lot of what they find enjoyable is the repartee of putting thoughts forward and defending them from assault from every angle. People with the Commander personality type are very smart and highly critical, and they won\u2019t back down if they are put on the defensive \u2013 in fact, there\u2019s no better way to earn their respect.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to stand up to a personality as big and blustery as Commanders\u2019, and they too often find that others crumple under the force they apply when they really start to enjoy themselves.\n\nOnly the most hardened rationalists are able to hold their ground against strongly expressed Commander personalities, who neither need emotional support, nor understand others\u2019 need for it. This lack of sensitivity is Commanders\u2019 chiefest weakness. Their tendency to challenge their friends, question their conclusions, and dismiss emotional arguments as irrelevant is especially difficult for Feeling-oriented friends to cope with. Either a point is supported by logic and reason, or it is erroneous.\n\nPrisoners of Our Own Minds\n\nMore enlightened Commanders recognize that if ever there was an area where they could learn from others and improve themselves, it is in the realm of emotional sensitivity \u2013 to dismiss any aspect of personal growth borders on hypocrisy. Friendships with people from the Diplomat type group can be especially rewarding for Commanders, as the shared Intuitive (N) trait fosters an instantaneous connection that can bridge the chasm between their uninhibited logic and the recognition that cooperation and conciliation can often accomplish more than that logic ever could alone.\n\nStill, the bulk of Commanders\u2019 friends will likely fall into the Analyst category, as all of these types share the same passion for logical, far-reaching ideas and critical debate. Anyone who can match Commanders\u2019 ability to brainstorm and theorize will find an honest and dedicated friend. Anyone who can\u2019t or won\u2019t, as with many more down-to-earth types who often question the point of such discussions, will find themselves ignored \u2013 perhaps a situation that is best for everyone.\n\n04"

This by no means suggests that people with the Commander personality type are bad parents \u2013 far from it \u2013 simply that their relationships with children, who are typically more sensitive and less able to conduct truly rational analysis, require a great deal more emotional tact and personal liberty than they are accustomed to giving.\n\nBut Commanders are always up for a challenge, and will take their roles as parents seriously and with the utmost sense of personal responsibility. Holding themselves to a higher standard than most, Commander personalities see the success of their children as a reflection of those personal standards, and want nothing more than to see them grow into smart, independent people who strive to achieve their goals. Establishing specific moral values is less important to Commanders than the cultivation of the intellect and independent, rational thought.\n\nRules Need Not Be Sacred\n\nCommanders welcome differences of opinion, and this is true with their children as well. But while gladly having rational, well-thought-out discussions about roles and responsibilities, at the end of the day Commanders expect their authority to be respected. A disagreement is no excuse for shirking established responsibilities, and Commander parents can be utterly uncompromising in maintaining this structure. This strictness can be a tremendous source of tension in the household \u2013 a little flexibility can go a long way.\n\nWhen these debates devolve into emotional appeals is when Commander parents run into real trouble, as their persistent weakness with emotional tolerance makes dealing with growing children, especially adolescents, their most significant challenge. As in their other relationships, Commander parents should strive to strengthen this skill \u2013 often enough young children don\u2019t have the words to express their needs rationally, and adolescents don\u2019t have the patience for it, a perfectly natural condition.\n\nBy learning to listen to emotional expression as a valid form of communication and responding in kind, Commanders can help to minimize emotional conflicts with their children, building trust that will help to smooth the otherwise rebellious teenage years.\nA Rendezvous With Destiny\n\nCommander parents should remember that a part of developing that necessary sense of independence is being able to control one\u2019s own schedule and activities, to chart one\u2019s own course, at least to a certain extent. People with the Commander personality type will spare no effort for their children, but it\u2019s sometimes the case that taking a deep breath and loosening their structures as their children grow and mature does more to achieve their goal of raising capable, intelligent adults than forced extracurriculars ever could.\n\n05"

No other personality type is better suited than Commanders to be the respected leader of an organization or team, and no other personality type enjoys it quite so much. Combining their vision, intelligence and determination to push ideas through to completion no matter the obstacles, Commanders are a force to be reckoned with.\n\nWe All Go Up, or We All Go Down\n\nIn the world of business, the sometimes overbearing level of self-confidence that Commanders (especially Assertive ones) too often mishandle in their personal relationships is transformed into an admirable authority, keeping people on track and getting things done. Naturally the best careers for people with the Commander personality type make the fullest use of these qualities, and many would describe executive positions and entrepreneurialism to be ideal lines of work \u2013 any position high enough that they can clearly see the horizon.\n\nFor Commanders, failure is not an option \u2013 they conceive a vision of the future, formulate a strategy to achieve that vision, and execute each step with ruthless precision.\n\nStructure and order are key, and if someone gets sloppy, or holds things back with incompetence, laziness or inefficiency, Commanders will not hesitate to come down, hard. Commander personalities pursue their goals with singular vision, and have strict standards for themselves and others that are designed above all else to be effective. This makes Commanders excellent corporate strategists, and their objectivity and clarity of thought make them respected lawyers and judges.\n\nNone of this could work if no one could understand what Commanders were thinking, and they have the good fortune of being clear and concise communicators, especially in person, making business administration a comfortable fit \u2013 so long as their tasks don\u2019t stray too far into routine maintenance and upkeep. Commanders also have a thirst for knowledge, and they aren\u2019t afraid to use a principle once they\u2019ve grasped its underlying mechanisms. Combining this with their leadership makes Commanders trying, but effective, university professors.\n\nWe Are Still in the Making\n\nThe only problem is, it takes time for Commanders\u2019 skills to be recognized, and stagnating as low-level employees will have them bouncing off the walls and deeply unhappy. People with the Commander personality type crave leadership and responsibility, growth and opportunity, and genuinely enjoy managing others to get a job done. Commanders are visionaries and leaders, not grunts or day-to-day administrators. Getting that to be recognized is not always easy, but Commanders are probably up to the task.\n\n06"

Commanders\u2019 efficiency and clear communication are valued, their leadership is admired, and their ability to simply get things done is unrivaled. That being said, some situations are more appropriate for Commanders than others \u2013 these qualities all point to a managerial or executive role, making any position of comparative powerlessness highly undesirable.\n\nCommander personality types are strident ones though, able to adapt themselves to just about any hierarchical relationship by doing what they do best: asserting their opinions, taking the initiative, and accomplishing feats that others thought impossible.\nCommander Subordinates\n\nSubordinate positions are challenging for Commanders, and it takes active management to ensure their satisfaction and engagement. Ever the high achievers, Commander subordinates set out to learn new skills and to seek out new challenges and responsibilities, eager to prove that nothing is impossible with a little hard work. If things get a little slow, Commander personalities may slip into periods of absentmindedness, but when they feel involved in the projects around them, they prove well organized and well prioritized.\n\nCommanders hold themselves to very high standards, but a lot of what sets this tone is feedback from their environment \u2013 namely, criticism from their managers. Objective, rational statements about what is done right and what can be done better are helpful to Commanders, and far from resenting such criticisms, they appreciate them. Opportunities for growth keep people with the Commander personality type engaged and productive, and so long as their managers recognize this as their primary responsibility, it will be a fruitful and satisfying relationship.\n\nCommander Colleagues\n\nAmong colleagues, Commanders are sociable and greatly enjoy sharing ideas and critiques in their frequent brainstorming sessions. Natural leaders that they are, Commanders tend to assert themselves into positions as representatives and project leads, considering their objectivity and charisma the perfect qualities for these roles. Commander personalities enjoy working with equals, but people must demonstrate that they are equals \u2013 anyone Commanders view as being less competent or driven will see only condescension and arrogance.\n\nCommanders are strong-willed, even dominant, and though they enjoy inspiring and tutoring others, the energy they bring to the process can seem overbearing. When these roles are reversed, Commanders\u2019 mentors should bear in mind that their students are very rational and respect firm confidence \u2013 hand-holding, emotional appeals or wavering indecision will likely burn the bridge then and there. In a partnership, what is best is what is most effective, and time wasted sugarcoating reality is just that \u2013 time wasted.\n\nCommander Managers\n\nCommander managers are confident, charismatic communicators, and they communicate but one vision: to get the job done as efficiently as possible, and to the highest standard of quality. All else is subordinate to that objective, but the means by which Commanders achieve it cause others to adopt this cause as their own. Commanders are natural leaders, and their ability to formulate a strategy and to identify the strengths of each member of their teams, incorporating those abilities into their plans so that each individual fills a unique and important role, makes them able motivators.\n\nBut while these efforts boost morale and satisfaction among Commanders\u2019 likeminded subordinates, they are still crafted to achieve that ultimate goal of timely and exceptional work. Those seen as inefficient by their Commander managers, or who demonstrate themselves to be lazy or to produce shoddy work will know in no uncertain terms of their failure to impress. The only way to recover is to comply, the only alternative is to find a new manager to impress, somewhere else.\n\n07"

                "content": "Introduction\n\nWHO IS A DEBATER (ENTP)?\n\nA Debater (ENTP) is a person with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits. They tend to be bold and creative, deconstructing and rebuilding ideas with great mental agility. They pursue their goals vigorously despite any resistance they might encounter.\n\nNo one loves the process of mental sparring more than the Debater personality type, as it gives them a chance to exercise their effortlessly quick wit, broad accumulated knowledge base, and capacity for connecting disparate ideas to prove their points. Debaters are the ultimate devil\u2019s advocate, thriving on the process of shredding arguments and beliefs and letting the ribbons drift in the wind for all to see. They don\u2019t always do this because they are trying to achieve some deeper purpose or strategic goal, though. Sometimes it\u2019s for the simple reason that it\u2019s fun.\n\nAn odd juxtaposition arises with Debaters, as they are uncompromisingly honest, but will argue tirelessly for something they don\u2019t actually believe in, stepping into another\u2019s shoes to argue a truth from another perspective.\n\nPlaying the devil\u2019s advocate helps people with the Debater personality type to not only develop a better sense of others\u2019 reasoning, but a better understanding of opposing ideas \u2013 since Debaters are the ones arguing them.\n\nThis tactic shouldn\u2019t be confused with the sort of mutual understanding Diplomat personalities seek \u2013 Debaters, like all Analyst personality types, are on a constant quest for knowledge, and what better way to gain it than to attack and defend an idea, from every angle, from every side?\n\nThere Are no Rules Here \u2013 We\u2019re Trying to Accomplish Something!\n\nFollow the path of the unsafe, independent thinker. Expose your ideas to the dangers of controversy. Speak your mind and fear less the label of \u2019crack-pot\u2019 than the stigma of conformity. And on issues that seem important to you, stand up and be counted at any cost.\n\nTHOMAS J. WATSON\n\nTaking a certain pleasure in being the underdog, Debaters enjoy the mental exercise found in questioning the prevailing mode of thought, making them irreplaceable in reworking existing systems or shaking things up and pushing them in clever new directions. However, they\u2019ll be miserable managing the day-to-day mechanics of actually implementing their suggestions. Debater personalities love to brainstorm and think big, but they will avoid getting caught doing the \u201cgrunt work\u201d at all costs. Debaters only make up about three percent of the population, which is just right, as it lets them create original ideas, then step back to let more numerous and fastidious personalities handle the logistics of implementation and maintenance.\n\nDebaters\u2019 capacity for debate can be a vexing one \u2013 while often appreciated when it\u2019s called for, it can fall painfully flat when they step on others\u2019 toes by say, openly questioning their boss in a meeting, or picking apart everything their significant other says. This is further complicated by Debaters\u2019 unyielding honesty, as this type doesn\u2019t mince words and cares little about being seen as sensitive or compassionate. Likeminded types get along well enough with people with the Debater personality type, but more sensitive types, and society in general, are often conflict-averse, preferring feelings, comfort, and even white lies over unpleasant truths and hard rationality.\n\nThis frustrates Debaters, and they find that their quarrelsome fun burns many bridges, oftentimes inadvertently, as they plow through others\u2019 thresholds for having their beliefs questioned and their feelings brushed aside. Treating others as they\u2019d be treated, Debaters have little tolerance for being coddled, and dislike when people beat around the bush, especially when asking a favor. Debater personalities find themselves respected for their vision, confidence, knowledge, and keen sense of humor, but often struggle to utilize these qualities as the basis for deeper friendships and romantic relationships.\n\nOpportunity Is Missed Because It Looks Like Hard Work\n\nDebaters have a longer road than most in harnessing their natural abilities \u2013 their intellectual independence and free-form vision are tremendously valuable when they\u2019re in charge, or at least have the ear of someone who is, but getting there can take a level of follow-through that Debaters struggle with.\n\nOnce they\u2019ve secured such a position, Debaters need to remember that for their ideas to come to fruition, they will always depend on others to assemble the pieces \u2013 if they\u2019ve spent more time \u201cwinning\u201d arguments than they have building consensus, many Debaters will find they simply don\u2019t have the support necessary to be successful. Playing devil\u2019s advocate so well, people with this personality type may find that the most complex and rewarding intellectual challenge is to understand a more sentimental perspective, and to argue consideration and compromise alongside logic and progress.\n\n01",

This information isn\u2019t usually absorbed for any planned purpose as with dedicated studying, people with the Debater personality type just find it fascinating.\nQuick Thinkers \u2013 Debaters have tremendously flexible minds, and are able to shift from idea to idea without effort, drawing on their accumulated knowledge to prove their points, or their opponents\u2019, as they see fit.\nOriginal \u2013 Having little attachment to tradition, Debater personalities are able to discard existing systems and methods and pull together disparate ideas from their extensive knowledge base, with a little raw creativity to hold them together, to formulate bold new ideas. If presented with chronic, systemic problems and given rein to solve them, Debaters respond with unabashed glee.\nExcellent Brainstormers \u2013 Nothing is quite as enjoyable to Debaters as analyzing problems from every angle to find the best solutions. Combining their knowledge and originality to splay out every aspect of the subject at hand, rejecting without remorse options that don\u2019t work and presenting ever more possibilities, Debaters are irreplaceable in brainstorming sessions.\nCharismatic \u2013 People with the Debater personality type have a way with words and wit that others find intriguing. Their confidence, quick thought and ability to connect disparate ideas in novel ways create a style of communication that is charming, even entertaining, and informative at the same time.\nEnergetic \u2013 When given a chance to combine these traits to examine an interesting problem, Debaters can be truly impressive in their enthusiasm and energy, having no qualms with putting in long days and nights to find a solution.\nDebater Weaknesses\nVery Argumentative \u2013 If there\u2019s anything Debaters enjoy, it\u2019s the mental exercise of debating an idea, and nothing is sacred. More consensus-oriented personality types rarely appreciate the vigor with which Debater personalities tear down their beliefs and methods, leading to a great deal of tension.\nInsensitive \u2013 Being so rational, Debaters often misjudge others feelings and push their debates well past others\u2019 tolerance levels. People with this personality type don\u2019t really consider emotional points to be valid in such debates either, which magnifies the issue tremendously.\nIntolerant \u2013 Unless people are able to back up their ideas in a round of mental sparring, Debaters are likely to dismiss not just the ideas but the people themselves. Either a suggestion can stand up to rational scrutiny or it\u2019s not worth bothering with.\nCan Find It Difficult to Focus \u2013 The same flexibility that allows Debaters to come up with such original plans and ideas makes them readapt perfectly good ones far too often, or to even drop them entirely as the initial excitement wanes and newer thoughts come along. Boredom comes too easily for Debaters, and fresh thoughts are the solution, though not always a helpful one.\nDislike Practical Matters \u2013 Debaters are interested in what could be \u2013 malleable concepts like ideas and plans that can be adapted and debated. When it comes to hard details and day-to-day execution where creative flair isn\u2019t just unnecessary but actually counter-productive, Debater personalities lose interest, often with the consequence of their plans never seeing the light of day.\n02"

                "content": "Romantic Relationships\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing Debaters are good at, it\u2019s coming up with a never-ending stream of innovations and ideas to keep things moving forward, and this is evident in their romantic relationships as well. For people with the Debater personality type growth is key, and even before they\u2019ve found a dating partner, they imagine all the ways that they can experience new things together, to grow in tandem. This can be an overwhelming process if their partner doesn\u2019t match up, but when Debaters find someone who shares their love of intellectual exploration, watch out.\n\nShow Me a Satisfied Man, and I\u2019ll Show You a Failure\n\nFrom the earliest dates, Debaters test their partners\u2019 limits for this kind of potential, pushing boundaries and traditions, looking for open-mindedness and spontaneity. Dating Debater personalities is hardly a boring experience, and they make use of their enthusiasm and creativity by delighting and surprising their partners with new ideas and experiences.\n\nDebaters\u2019 idea of fun is often rooted in self-improvement, and people with this personality type bring their partners along the way, as much in a spirit of sharing as in a spirit of expectation. Debaters see either growth or stagnation and don\u2019t buy into the idea of a happy status quo, making them demanding as much as they are exciting.\n\nSome may tire in the face of this constant improvement \u2013 while Debaters\u2019 vigor can be attractive, it can also wear down even the most patient partners. A little time to breathe and a chance to rest on one\u2019s laurels for a moment is necessary for many people, but not something Debaters are likely to appreciate. However, if their unwavering enthusiasm is met in kind, it can lead to a magnificent relationship characterized by its strength, depth, and spark.\n\nGenius Is One Percent Inspiration and Ninety-Nine Percent Perspiration\n\nThis is perhaps most evident as Debaters\u2019 relationships progress into more intimate situations. All that exploratory curiosity and enthusiasm has a chance to be expressed in new ways when Debaters and their partners come together, and they readily encourage their partners to try new things, to enjoy their intimacy without preconceived limitations.\n\nFor people with the Debater personality type, this phase of their relationships is a chance to improve and develop in areas that are outside the realm of academia, though they approach it in much the same way \u2013 as a physical and intellectual process of striving towards excellence, rather than a spiritual or emotional expression of affection.\n\nDebaters\u2019 desire to improve in this department makes them fantastic partners when the relationship reaches that point, but their attitude towards this process is also evidence of their most glaring shortcoming \u2013 their emotional obliviousness. While Debaters are more open-minded than other Analyst personality types about others\u2019 perspectives, they are also more likely to express their disdain for such things as emotional sensitivity in cuttingly well-phrased and clear terms, easily hurting their partners\u2019 feelings without realizing it. Debater personalities may even ignore their partners\u2019 feelings altogether, instead immersing themselves entirely in some distant idea or opportunity, inaccessible.\n\nWhere Debaters\u2019 unwavering desire for self-improvement comes in most handy is in their emotional development, as they may actually be willing to work on areas such as sensitivity and emotional communication with their partners.\n\nDebaters\u2019 best compatibility rests with other Intuitive (N) types, with one or two opposing traits which help to create both balance and opportunities for growth. If they are with a more sensitive partner, this can be an excellent way for them to find another quality that they can work on together, making this weakness yet another opportunity to be creative, challenge themselves, and to deepen the attractiveness that this sense of progression brings to their relationships.\n\n03"

                "content": "Friendships\n\nLoyalty, support, emotional feedback \u2013 these are not what Debaters look for in their friendships. The last thing people with the Debater personality type want to hear is \u201cyou\u2019re right\u201d, not unless they have absolutely earned the distinction in a heated round of intellectual debate. If they\u2019re wrong, Debaters want to be told so, and they want every detail of the faults in their logic to be laid bare, partly in their quest for oftentimes arbitrary truth, and partly just so they have to work to defend that logic with counterpoint and parry.\n\nIt\u2019s often easy for Debaters to test compatibility with a potential friend \u2013 they just need to test combatability. Debater personalities are quick-witted, and their primary means of expressing this is in the form of arguments and discussions, where they will easily spend an entire evening debating an idea they may not even believe in.\n\nThe epitome of Debaters\u2019 friendships is when someone can hold their ground in these arbitrary debates with valid, rational arguments.\n\nThese debates are never taken personally, no matter how heated they become or how striking the disagreement. Much as an athlete competes for the physical exertion and the spirit of competition itself, Debaters debate for the sake intellectual stimulation and for the debate itself, and even in overwhelming victory or crushing defeat, it\u2019s never about dominance, only inspiration to try harder next time.\n\nWhen You Play, Play Hard\n\nThey know how to relax and have fun too, it\u2019s just that \u201cfun\u201d to Debaters \u2013 a bottle of wine and a discussion about the causes of and solutions to the European migrant crisis \u2013 could be described as \u201can evening from hell\u201d by many other personalities. But Debaters are a genial and enthusiastic personality type for the most part, and pretty much any situation that allows for conversation and a little wordplay is an enjoyable outing.\n\nDebaters are actually remarkably good at communicating with friends and acquaintances of other personality types. Their natural tendency to argue as effectively as possible means that Debaters are accustomed to communicating in other people\u2019s language and frame of reference, and this translates well into normal conversation. Where people with the Debater personality type do have difficulty relating to others is in emotional expression, the Achilles\u2019 heel of all Analyst types.\n\nThe Worst Thinking Has Been Done in Turmoil\n\nBeing inclined to suppress their emotions and feelings, when Debaters are faced with a friend who, figuratively or literally, needs a shoulder to cry on, they have no clue how to handle the situation. They are perfectly willing and happy to offer a series of rational, reasonable solutions to the problem at hand, as Debaters do for any situation where a problem needs to be fixed, but they are certainly not known for their sensitivity or outward affection, no matter how intuitively they may understand another\u2019s position.\n\nWorse is when Debater personalities try to turn these emotional situations into something they find more comfortable: a debate. Given how remarkably good Debaters are at arguing both sides of a point, they are remarkably bad at putting themselves in someone else\u2019s shoes from an emotional standpoint. Debaters should avoid at all costs the temptation to turn a discussion about the causes of a friend\u2019s recent breakup into competitive intellectual fodder.\n\nSo long as everyone understands not to take their words too personally, anyone who isn\u2019t afraid to discuss new ideas \u2013 and have them converted into so much confetti \u2013 is likely to find stimulating and thought-provoking friends in Debaters. It\u2019s not a compatibility that clicks with everyone, but Debaters don\u2019t really care about being liked by everyone anyways. As long as they get to alternate between being the sounding board and the megaphone, Debaters and their friends are bound to enjoy each other\u2019s company for a long, long time.\n\n04"

However, one thing people with the Debater personality type love more than just about anything is a good challenge, a problem to fix, even if it comes to addressing their own weaknesses. Debaters take their roles as parents seriously, and they are bound to be affected profoundly by this development in their lives \u2013 if anyone is able to take an outside influence, like their children, and use that influence to address their own faults, it is Debaters.\n\nBe Brave, Have Faith, Go Forward!\n\nFrom the beginning Debaters\u2019 distaste for rules and regulations is evident, and they are likely to give their young children the freedom necessary to explore on their own. Independence is one of Debaters\u2019 greatest needs, and they feel that no person is complete without an independent mind.\n\nDebater personalities create relaxed, unorthodox environments for their children, founded on enthusiasm and the joy of discovery through the development of reason, not heavily structured settings designed merely to be safe.\n\nAs their children grow and develop, Debaters encourage them to think independently and voice objections, opinions and alternatives. But unlike Diplomat parents, who encourage their children to express their thoughts in terms of feelings and needs, Debaters teach their children to approach these options from a position of impartiality and logic, to state what is more effective rather than what would make them feel good. As in other relationships, this quality of emotional inaccessibility is where Debaters struggle.\n\nAs their children grow into adolescence and learn to find a balance in healthy emotional expression, people with the Debater personality type may find themselves exasperated. While always up for a good debate on just about any subject, Debaters often need their partners\u2019 help in managing more emotional outbursts and arguments. Debaters are more able than most, but even they have their limits and rules when it comes to vocal conflict.\n\nThere\u2019s a Way to Do It Better \u2013 Find It.\n\nLuckily, Debater personalities recognize what\u2019s at stake: they want their children to grow into smart, independent, honest adults. To convey those values, Debaters know that they need, like with any other debate, to communicate in terms that are accessible to all sides. If that means learning how to use the tools of emotional expression and appeals, and in so doing becoming more emotionally expressive in real, personal terms as well, so be it.\n\n05"

                "content": "Career Paths\n\nIn the world of careers, Debaters have the benefit of being naturally engaged and interested in being productive and helpful. But rather than the sort of people-oriented helpfulness that Diplomat personality types bring to the table, Debater personalities are focused on developing solutions to interesting and diverse technical and intellectual problems. Debaters are a versatile personality type, and while it may take time for them to get to a point where they can fully utilize their skillset and qualities, they are likely to find that those qualities translate well into pretty much any career that so much as piques their interest.\n\nIf there\u2019s anything Debaters love, it\u2019s flexing their mental muscles, and any environment that lets them devise new approaches, new ideas and new projects, that allows them to push the limits of their creativity, will benefit strongly from what Debaters bring to the table.\n\nNot every career allows this level of unbridled brainpower, but there are those that demand nothing but: entrepreneurship, engineering, even acting and photography. So long as Debaters are honest with themselves about their strengths and weaknesses, they can thrive in most any career that is in need of a new line of thinking.\n\nThe Value of an Idea Lies in the Using of It\n\nAll this intellectual power can be intimidating, but unlike their Introverted (I) cousins, people with the Debater personality type have the added benefit of being excellent communicators, in the written word but especially in face-to-face conversation. Though they dislike the constraints of managing others (and of being managed), this social adaptability allows Debaters to be natural leaders, showing the way forward and inspiring others with sound logic and intellectual prowess. While others may object to these plans with emotional considerations or general resistance to change, things Debaters place little value in, these competing comments are usually outmaneuvered by Debater personalities\u2019 deft arguments and subtly shifting goals.\n\nThe best careers reward intellectual competency and curiosity, allowing Debaters to utilize their never-ending flow of ideas productively by affording a degree of spontaneity in how they engage their intellectual pursuits. People with the Debater personality type value knowledge, rational thought and insight very highly, and they make brilliant lawyers, psychologists, systems analysts and scientists. It\u2019s even possible for Debaters to thrive as sales representatives, as they rationalize purchase decisions that may otherwise seem discretionary \u2013 so long as their managers know to give them the space they need to work their magic.\n\nBeing Busy Doesn\u2019t Always Mean Real Work\n\nReally it all comes down to a sense of personal freedom, for Debaters to know that they are allowed to apply themselves fully to understanding and solving the problems that interest them, without getting bogged down by social politics and trying to figure out what makes other people \u201ctick\u201d. Routine, structure and formal rules all feel like unnecessary hindrances to Debaters, and they may find that their best careers yet allow them to engage their intellectual pursuits on their own terms, as freelance consultants or software engineers.\n\nThe key for Debaters is to have the patience to get to a position that allows for these freedoms, to be in an environment long enough that not just their colleagues, but their managers and, in time, their subordinates, recognize what it is that they bring to the table. Debaters have exceptional qualities \u2013 it\u2019s quantifying their achievements and skills that presents the biggest challenge. But once they\u2019ve got their foot in the door, once they\u2019ve got a willing ear higher in the hierarchy, the sky\u2019s the limit.\n\n06"

                "content": "Workplace Habits\n\nDebaters have straightforward expectations in the workplace, but ones that aren\u2019t always easy to meet. Strong believers in meritocracy, people with the Debater personality type expect their ideas to be heard by those above them, expect robust debate among their peers, and demand that those they manage offer up new solutions and ideas regardless of their positions. While this isn\u2019t always how things play out in reality, Debaters know what to look for, and can avoid those strictly hierarchical institutions that they would otherwise struggle with.\n\nDebater Subordinates\n\nThis dynamic is clearest with Debater subordinates, as they are comfortable challenging their managers\u2019 ideas and have a strong (and well-expressed) dislike for restrictive rules and guidelines. Debaters back this unorthodox behavior with their keen minds and curiosity, and are as capable of adopting new methods as they are of suggesting others do so. If something can be done better, it\u2019s as simple as that, and Debater personalities gladly take criticism, so long as it\u2019s logical and performance-oriented.\n\nThe biggest challenge for Debater subordinates is that it is often the fate of the \u201clower\u201d positions to implement the details, do the dirty work and follow through on plans set out by their managers. This couldn\u2019t be further from what Debaters prefer to spend their time on \u2013 they can\u2019t stand simple, routine work, and monotonous tasks are the stuff of nightmares. Things go over much better if managers are able to properly utilize Debaters\u2019 preference for tackling complex challenges and diverse projects.\n\nDebater Colleagues\n\nIt is as colleagues that Debaters prove most polarizing, as their passions for brainstorming, debate and over-analysis drive more practical, task-oriented colleagues crazy, but serve as stimulating inspiration for those who appreciate the innovation Debaters bring. Nothing bothers people with the Debater personality type more than getting out of a meeting where everyone agreed with the first plan presented, only to hear everyone complain about how stupid the plan was ten minutes later \u2013 but they \u201cdidn\u2019t want to make waves\u201d. Debaters strive for honest, direct and objective assessments of these ideas, so much so that they often earn reputations for their insensitivity and condescension.\n\nLuckily Debaters know how to relax too, and their witty wordplay, healthy sense of humor and outgoing nature win new friends quickly and easily. Always willing to draw on their repository of knowledge, conversations with Debater personalities are informative and entertaining, which makes it easy for them to be the go-to person for tough problems that stump more rote approaches. Peer-to-peer relationships with Debaters aren\u2019t always easy, but it\u2019s tough to argue that they don\u2019t work.\n\nDebater Managers\n\nWhile not always their goal, management is often where Debaters are most at home, allowing them the freedom to fiddle with different approaches and come up with innovative ways to tackle new challenges without having to handle the tedious step-by-step implementation of these plans. Debaters are open-minded and flexible managers, not just granting but also expecting the same freedom of thought that they themselves enjoy. This can lead to disorder, conflicting ideas and approaches being put forward, but Debaters are also great at accurately and objectively assessing which plan is likely to be most effective.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t always make friends, but being liked is less Debaters\u2019 goal than being respected and seen as intelligent and capable. And liked or no, people with this personality type hold firm ground in rational debates, making them fearsome advocates for their teams. The challenge for Debaters is focus, as they may find themselves jumping from project to project in a quest for challenge and excitement before their teams are able to wrap up the details of their existing goals and obligations.\n\n07"

What if you moved beyond fear to pursue what you secretly want to achieve in life?\n\nWe can show you how to use your strengths to unlock your exceptional potential and avoid common pitfalls, while also staying true to who you are \u2013 after all, that\u2019s the point.

                "content": "Introduction\n\nWHO IS AN ADVOCATE (INFJ)?\n\nAn Advocate (INFJ) is someone with the Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging personality traits. They tend to approach life with deep thoughtfulness and imagination. Their inner vision, personal values, and a quiet, principled version of humanism guide them in all things.\n\n\u201cTreat people as if they were what they ought to be and you help them to become what they are capable of being.\u201d\n\nJOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE\n\nAdvocates are the rarest personality types of all. Still, Advocates leave their mark on the world. They have a deep sense of idealism and integrity, but they aren\u2019t idle dreamers \u2013 they take concrete steps to realize their goals and make a lasting impact.\n\nAdvocates\u2019 unique combination of personality traits makes them complex and quite versatile. For example, Advocates can speak with great passion and conviction, especially when standing up for their ideals. At other times, however, they may choose to be soft-spoken and understated, preferring to keep the peace rather than challenge others.\n\nStanding Up for What\u2019s Right\n\nAdvocates generally strive to do what\u2019s right \u2013 and they want to help create a world where others do the right thing as well. People with this personality type may feel called to use their strengths \u2013 including creativity, imagination, and sensitivity \u2013 to uplift others and spread compassion. Concepts like egalitarianism and karma can mean a great deal to Advocates.\n\nAdvocates may see helping others as their purpose in life. They are troubled by injustice, and they typically care more about altruism than personal gain. As a result, Advocates tend to step in when they see someone facing unfairness or hardship. Many people with this personality type also aspire to fix society\u2019s deeper problems, in the hope that unfairness and hardship can become things of the past.\n\nNothing lights up Advocates like creating a solution that changes people\u2019s lives.\nConnecting with Others (and Themselves)\n\nAdvocates may be reserved, but they communicate in a way that is warm and sensitive. This emotional honesty and insight can make a powerful impression on the people around them.\n\nAdvocates value deep, authentic relationships with others, and they tend to take great care with other people\u2019s feelings. That said, these personalities also need to prioritize reconnecting with themselves. Advocates need to take some time alone now and then to decompress, recharge, and process their thoughts and feelings.\n\nThe Cost of Success\n\nAt times, Advocates may focus so intently on their ideals that they don\u2019t take care of themselves. Advocates may feel that they aren\u2019t allowed to rest until they\u2019ve achieved their unique vision of success, but this mindset can lead to stress and burnout. If this happens, people with this personality type may find themselves feeling uncharacteristically ill-tempered.\n\nAdvocates might find themselves feeling especially stressed in the face of conflict and criticism. These personalities tend to act with the best of intentions, and it can frustrate them when others don\u2019t appreciate this. At times, even constructive criticism may feel deeply personal or hurtful to Advocates.\n\nA Personal Mission\n\nMany Advocates feel compelled to find a mission for their lives. When they encounter inequity or unfairness, they tend to think, \u201cHow can I fix this?\u201d They are well-suited to support a movement to right a wrong, no matter how big or small. Advocates just need to remember that while they\u2019re busy taking care of the world, they need to take care of themselves too.\n\n01",

                "content": "Strengths & Weaknesses\nAdvocate (INFJ) Strengths\nCreative \u2013 Advocate personalities enjoy finding the perfect solution for the people they care about. To do this, they draw on their vivid imagination and their strong sense of compassion. This can make them excellent counselors and advisors.\nInsightful \u2013 Advocates typically strive to move past appearances and get to the heart of things. This can give them an almost uncanny ability to understand people\u2019s true motivations, feelings, and needs.\nPrincipled \u2013 People with the Advocate personality type tend to have deeply held beliefs, and their conviction often shines through when they speak or write about subjects that matter to them. Advocates can be compelling and inspiring communicators, with their idealism persuading even the hardest of skeptics.\nPassionate \u2013 Advocates can pursue their ideals with a single-mindedness that may catch others off guard. These personalities rarely settle for \u201cgood enough,\u201d and their willingness to disrupt the status quo may not please everyone. That said, Advocates\u2019 passion for their chosen cause is a key aspect of their personality.\nAltruistic \u2013 Advocates generally aim to use their strengths for the greater good \u2013 they rarely enjoy succeeding at other people\u2019s expense. They tend to think about how their actions affect others, and their goal is to behave in a way that will help the people around them and make the world a better place.\nAdvocate (INFJ) Weaknesses\nSensitive to Criticism \u2013 When someone challenges their principles or values, Advocates may react strongly. People with this personality type can become defensive in the face of criticism and conflict, particularly when it comes to issues that are near to their hearts.\nReluctant to Open Up \u2013 Advocates value honesty, but they\u2019re also private. They may find it difficult to open up and be vulnerable about their struggles. This might also be because they think they need to solve their problems on their own or don\u2019t want to burden other people with their issues. When Advocates don\u2019t ask for help, they may inadvertently hold themselves back or create distance in their relationships.\nPerfectionistic \u2013 The Advocate personality type is all but defined by idealism. While this is a wonderful quality in many ways, an ideal situation is not always possible. Advocates might find it difficult to appreciate their jobs, living situations, or relationships if they\u2019re continually fixating on imperfections and wondering whether they should be looking for something better.\nAvoiding the Ordinary \u2013 Advocate personalities tend to be motivated by a sense of having a greater purpose in life. They might consider it tedious or unnecessary to break their big visions into small, manageable steps. But they may be setting themselves up for frustration if they don\u2019t turn their dreams into everyday routines and to-do lists. Without these specifics, their goals may never materialize.\nProne to Burnout \u2013 Advocates\u2019 perfectionism and reserve may leave them with few options for letting off steam. People with this personality type can exhaust themselves if they don\u2019t find a way to balance their drive to help others with necessary self-care and rest.\n02"

People with this personality type look for depth and meaning in their relationships, preferring not to settle for a match that\u2019s founded on anything less than true love.\n\nIt can take time for Advocates to find a compatible partner. Some people might think Advocates are too choosy, and it\u2019s true that these personalities can have unrealistic expectations. Some Advocates might hold out for a \u201cperfect\u201d partner or relationship that ultimately doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nThat said, Advocates\u2019 idealism \u2013 if balanced with just enough realism \u2013 can actually enhance their love lives. Advocate personalities tend to be in touch with their core values, so they care about compatibility as well as surface-level attraction. This can help them avoid matches that aren\u2019t founded on authenticity or shared principles.\n\nOnce Advocates do find a suitable relationship, they rarely take it for granted. Instead, they tend to look for ways to grow as individuals and strengthen their connection with their partner. This can help Advocates\u2019 relationships reach a level of depth and sincerity of which many people can only dream.\n\nIs This for Real?\n\nAdvocates care about integrity, and they tend to bristle when people try to change them or talk them into something that they don\u2019t believe. As a result, Advocate personalities gravitate toward partners who appreciate them as they are. And there\u2019s a great deal to appreciate about Advocates: they\u2019re warm, caring, honest, and insightful, with an ability to see the truth that lies beneath surface appearances.\n\nPeople with this personality type create a depth to their relationships that can hardly be described in conventional terms. Because of their sensitivity and insight, Advocates can make their partners feel heard and understood in beautiful ways. Advocates aren\u2019t afraid to express their love, and they feel it unconditionally.\n\nOne of the things Advocates find most important is establishing genuine, deep connections with the people they care about.\n\nAdvocates tend to recognize that love isn\u2019t a passive emotion but rather an opportunity to grow and learn, and they expect their partners to share this mindset. As a result, relationships with Advocates are not for the uncommitted or the shallow.\n\nWhen it comes to intimacy, Advocates can be incredibly passionate in ways that go beyond the physical. People with this personality type crave an emotional and even spiritual connection with their partner. They cherish not just the act of being in a relationship but also what it means to become one with another person in mind, body, and soul.\n\n03"

As a result, people with this personality type rarely settle for friendships of convenience. Rather than rely on superficial interactions with the people they see every day at work or school, they generally prefer to have a close circle of confidants.\n\nAdvocates tend to light up around friends who share their passions, interests, and beliefs. Few things give these personalities more pleasure than connecting with others over discussions about meaningful ideas and philosophies. Once Advocates know they can trust someone completely, they find it incredibly fulfilling to share their innermost thoughts, ideas, and feelings with them.\n\nSearching for a Heart of Gold\n\nJust as Advocates have high standards for themselves, they also have high standards for their friendships. They want to feel compatible with their friends on a deep level. In addition, Advocate personalities generally want to surround themselves with people who will inspire them to grow and improve. Most Advocates don\u2019t just want to have fun with their friends \u2013 they also want to learn new things, make new discoveries, and deepen their bonds.\n\nThis is a tall order, and Advocates may feel that it\u2019s difficult to meet the sort of friends they\u2019re searching for. Because Advocates are a rare personality type, they may meet relatively few people who really remind them of themselves. As a result, they may feel as if they need to settle for less-than-fulfilling friendships or else accept being alone.\n\nFortunately, Advocates are more than capable of finding the types of friends they long to meet \u2013 they might just have to use their intuition to do so. In their quiet, understated way, Advocate personality types have a knack for seeing beyond appearances and understanding people\u2019s deeper natures. They can use this ability to move past first impressions and figure out whether someone\u2019s interests, values, and attitudes might be compatible with their own. By doing this, Advocates can befriend people who might seem totally different from them but who are compatible on a deeper level.\n\nIn friendship, it\u2019s as though Advocates are searching for a soul mate, someone who shares every facet of their passions and imagination.\nLoyalty and Authenticity\n\nAdvocates have a quiet determination that can be quite charismatic, and their ability to express themselves clearly and passionately can make them truly shine. At times, these traits may lead to unwanted attention and popularity for Advocates, who tend to be private.\n\nAdvocates may sometimes find themselves surrounded by people who want to impress them. Paradoxically, this can make it more difficult for people with this personality type to find friends with whom they feel a connection. After all, the only way to be counted among Advocates\u2019 true friends is to be authentic, honest, and real.\n\nOnce they do find genuine friends, people with the Advocate personality type make loyal and caring companions. With their trademark warmth and enthusiasm, they support their friends\u2019 efforts to grow and expand their lives. In general, Advocate personalities don\u2019t require a great deal of day-to-day attention from their friends. For them, quality trumps quantity \u2013 and that includes the time they spend with their nearest and dearest.\n\nAs trust grows, Advocates tend to share more of their inner lives with their friends. If these revelations are met with acceptance and support, this can herald the sort of friendship that transcends time and distance, lasting a lifetime.\n\nOver the years, Advocates may end up with just a few true friendships rather than a wide circle of casual acquaintances. But as long as those friendships are built on a richness of mutual understanding, Advocates wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\n\n04"

But adversity is often the thing that gives us character and backbone.\u201d\n\nNICOLE KIDMAN\n\nAs parents, Advocates (INFJs) tend to look at their relationships with their children as opportunities to learn and grow with someone they care about. These personality types also work to achieve another important goal: raising their children to be independent and all-around good people.\n\nAdvocate parents generally strive to be devoted and loving toward their children at all times. As they imagine their children\u2019s futures, what Advocates really look forward to is being able to interact and connect as equals with the people they helped raise.\n\nBe Unique, Just Like Me\n\nAs their children grow, Advocates may unconsciously project a great deal of their own beliefs onto them. People with this personality type often expect their children to demonstrate the same integrity and honesty that they expect from themselves.\n\nAt the same time, Advocate personalities may also push their children to think independently, make their own choices, and develop their own beliefs. Depending on the child\u2019s developmental stage and temperament, they might find these expectations confusing or stressful \u2013 even though their Advocate parents have the best of intentions.\n\nAdvocate parents want to raise children who are ethical, creative, and kind.\n\nIf all this independence is taken to heart, it can cause some trouble for Advocate parents as their children move into the more rebellious phase of adolescence. This is especially true if their children choose beliefs that go against their values as Advocate parents. In this situation, Advocates may feel as if their children are criticizing or rejecting them \u2013 a hurtful thing to such a sensitive personality type.\n\nA Job Well Done\n\nUltimately, Advocate parents tend to realize that it isn\u2019t a sign of failure if their children turn out differently than they\u2019d expected. Instead, they come to see this as a sign that they\u2019ve successfully helped raise someone who has the ability to form their own ideals. Advocates\u2019 children often come to appreciate the combination of independence and integrity with which they were raised \u2013 especially as they get older.\n\nAdvocates strive to make sure that their children grow up with a firm understanding of the difference between right and wrong. Parents with this personality type encourage their children to fight for a cause they believe in and to be the best they can be. Whatever age their children might be, Advocates can find a great deal of fulfillment and meaning simply in helping their children learn to be true to themselves.\n\n05"

Fortunately, people with this personality type are able to find work that suits them in just about any field.\n\nIn fact, many Advocates have trouble deciding which job is best for them because they\u2019re able to imagine so many possibilities. These personalities may see 10 wildly different paths forward, each with its own set of rewards. This can be exciting but also stress-inducing, because picking just one means letting go of so many others.\n\nTruth, Beauty, Purpose\n\nAdvocates want to find meaning in their work and to know that they are helping and connecting with people. This desire to help and connect can make roles as counselors, psychologists, teachers, social workers, yoga instructors, and spiritual leaders very rewarding for Advocates. Careers in health care \u2013 especially the more holistic varieties \u2013 can also be attractive options for this personality type.\n\nMany Advocates are also strong communicators. This explains why they are often drawn to careers in writing, authoring many popular books, blogs, stories, and screenplays. Music, photography, design, and art can all be viable options as well, allowing Advocates to focus on deeper themes of personal growth and purpose.\n\nThat said, Advocates can excel in a range of fields. Wherever they work, people with this personality type can find ways to help others. They can also find ways to use their creativity in nearly any position. No matter what it says on their business cards, Advocates\u2019 insight can enable them to spot unusual patterns and come up with out-of-the-box solutions, creating real change in others\u2019 lives.\n\nFor Advocates, money and Employee of the Month simply won\u2019t cut it. These personalities want a career that fits their values and principles.\nTwo Roads Diverged in a Yellow Wood\n\nAdvocates\u2019 needs may be hard to meet in some work environments, especially those that offer little independence and agency. Advocate personalities are sometimes drawn to behind-the-scenes and noncompetitive roles, but these jobs can lead to frustration if they don\u2019t allow Advocates to act as they see fit, grow as individuals, and make a difference.\n\nFor this reason, people with the Advocate personality type may feel fulfilled by seeking out leadership positions or by starting their own business. By finding jobs that offer more autonomy, Advocates can focus on applying their creativity and integrity to everything they do. Advocates may also find it gratifying to create bridges between seemingly disparate professional fields \u2013 for example, by writing about psychology or by being an environmental lawyer. These hybrid careers can offer plenty of opportunities for Advocates to exercise their creativity and their love of learning.\n\nWhere Advocates struggle is in work that doesn\u2019t take personal needs into consideration, is overly repetitious, or promotes conflict. Jobs with these characteristics can leave Advocates frustrated and unfulfilled. People with this personality type may also chafe at the criticism and pressure that come with cutthroat, competitive work environments.\n\nA Sense of Mission\n\nIn truth, Advocate personalities can do well in any field. To be truly happy, however, they need to find work that aligns with their values and allows them some independence. Advocates crave opportunities to learn and grow alongside the people they are helping. When this happens, Advocates may finally feel as if they are fulfilling their life\u2019s mission, contributing to the well-being of humanity on a personal level.\n\n06"

People with this personality type want to know that their work helps people and promotes their own personal growth. This means that their work must be in line with their values, principles, and beliefs.\n\nIn the workplace, Advocates tend to thrive when they have opportunities to express their creativity and insight, and they\u2019re especially motivated when they know that what they\u2019re doing has meaning. They also tend to do best when they can ignore workplace politics and hierarchies and simply do what matters to them. Most people with this personality type prefer not to think of themselves as above or below anyone else \u2013 no matter where they are on the job ladder.\n\nFortunately, Advocates are resourceful and creative, and they can find ways to make nearly any position work for them.\n\nAdvocate Subordinates\n\nAdvocates value cooperation, sensitivity, and independence. As employees, they tend to gravitate toward managers who are open-minded and willing to consider their input. Advocate personalities may become frustrated when they feel unheard, so having a manager who listens to them can make all the difference.\n\nIdeally, Advocates will also find a manager whose values align with their own and who offers them encouragement and praise. Because Advocates tend to act on their convictions and aim to do their best, their morale can be vulnerable to criticism, particularly if it\u2019s unwarranted. Other morale killers for these personalities may include strict rules, formal structures, and routine tasks.\n\nOf course, a perfect work environment isn\u2019t always possible. Advocate employees with less-than-ideal managers may need to draw on their inner resilience and seek out other mentors. The good news is that people with this personality type are more than capable of handling workplace challenges, including the challenge of having a difficult manager.\n\nAdvocate Colleagues\n\nAs colleagues, Advocates can be quite popular and well-respected. People with this personality type are likely to be seen as positive, eloquent, and capable coworkers. Among their greatest strengths is their ability to identify others\u2019 motives and defuse conflicts and tension before anyone else even senses a disturbance.\n\nAt times, efficiency may be less of a priority for Advocates than collaborating with and helping colleagues who need a boost. While this is usually a strength, there is a risk that others will take advantage of their desire to help. Advocates may find themselves picking up the slack for their less dedicated coworkers at the expense of their own energy and well-being.\n\nAlthough they tend to be warm and approachable colleagues, Advocates are still Introverts. From time to time, they may need to step back and work alone, pursuing their own goals in their own ways.\n\nAdvocate Managers\n\nAs managers, Advocates may dislike wielding their power. These personalities prefer to see those who work under them as equals. Rather than micromanage their subordinates, Advocates often prefer to empower them to think and act independently. They work hard to encourage others, not to crack the whip.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that Advocates have low standards \u2013 far from it. Their sense of equality means that they expect their subordinates to live up to the standards that they set for themselves. Advocate personalities want their employees to be rigorous, motivated, reliable, and unfailingly honest, and they will notice if their employees miss the mark.\n\nCompassionate and fair, Advocate managers often take pride in identifying their subordinates\u2019 unique strengths. They make an effort to understand their employees\u2019 motivations \u2013 an effort that is helped by Advocates\u2019 Intuitive insights.\n\nThat said, people with this personality type can be quite stern if they catch someone behaving in a way that they consider unethical. Advocates have little tolerance for lapses in reliability or morality. When their employees\u2019 good intentions match their own, however, Advocates will work tirelessly to ensure that their entire team feels valued and fulfilled.\n\n07"

Unlike many other idealistic types, however, you are also capable of turning your ideals into plans and executing them.\n\nYet Advocates face challenges too.

These rare personality types tend to be quiet, open-minded, and imaginative, and they apply a caring and creative approach to everything they do.\n\nOn the outside, Mediators (INFPs) may seem quiet or even shy. But they often have vibrant, passionate inner lives. Because they make up such a small portion of the population, people with this personality type may sometimes feel misunderstood or out of step with the world. Fortunately, their caring nature can help them create and sustain deep relationships with their loved ones.\n\nMediators value authenticity, empathy, and harmony. These personalities tend to act with the best of intentions, and they are rightly proud of this trait. That said, they may feel isolated or discouraged when other people don\u2019t share their idealism.\n\nAll that is gold does not glitter; not all those who wander are lost; the old that is strong does not wither; deep roots are not reached by the frost.\n\nJ. R. R. TOLKIEN\nSpeaking Their Truth\n\nMany Mediators are curious about the depths of human nature, and they often make an effort to understand other people\u2019s true feelings. This can make them capable of great empathy. It can also enable them to communicate in ways that are sensitive, original, and quite moving.\n\nPerhaps because of these strengths, Mediators tend to crave opportunities for creative self-expression. It comes as no surprise that many famous Mediators are poets, writers, and actors. People with this personality type often enjoy dreaming up all sorts of stories and possibilities.\n\nMediators have a talent for self-expression. They may reveal their innermost thoughts and secrets through metaphors and fictional characters.\n\nBy using their imaginations in this way, Mediators can explore their inner nature and their place in the world. That said, they can have a tendency to daydream and fantasize rather than take action. If they don\u2019t act on their dreams and ideas, Mediators are likely to end up feeling frustrated or unfulfilled.\n\nIn Search of a Calling\n\nMediators may feel directionless or stuck unless they connect with a sense of purpose for their lives. For many Mediators, this purpose has something to do with helping and uplifting others. Empathetic by nature, these personalities may feel other people\u2019s suffering as if it were their own. This only strengthens their motivation to be of service.\n\nAlthough Mediators might want to help everyone, they may need to focus their attention and energy on one worthy cause at a time. Otherwise, they can become so overwhelmed by all the problems they can\u2019t fix that they\u2019re tempted to give up on even trying. This is a sad sight for Mediators\u2019 friends, who often depend on their hopeful outlook.\n\nFortunately, like flowers in the spring, Mediators\u2019 creativity and idealism can bloom even after the darkest of seasons. Although they know the world will never be perfect, Mediators still care about making it better however they can. This quiet belief in doing the right thing may explain why these personalities so often inspire compassion, kindness, and beauty wherever they go.\n\n01",

They adjust their actions if they think they might hurt anyone, even unintentionally. Kindheartedness flows from Mediator personalities, and everyone around them tends to benefit from it.\nGenerous \u2013 Mediators rarely enjoy succeeding at others\u2019 expense. In general, people with this personality type want to share the good things in their lives. They value equality, and they want to ensure that every voice and perspective is heard.\nOpen-Minded \u2013 Mediators tend to give other people the benefit of the doubt. They aim to be tolerant of other people\u2019s beliefs, lifestyles, and decisions. Generally speaking, Mediators support others\u2019 right to live as they see fit \u2013 as long as no one is being hurt.\nCreative \u2013 Mediators can often see things from unconventional perspectives. With their ability to make surprising and unexpected connections, it\u2019s no wonder that many Mediators are drawn to creative pursuits and the arts.\nPassionate \u2013 When an idea or movement captures Mediators\u2019 imagination and speaks to their beliefs, they can give their whole heart to it. People with this personality type can be reserved or reticent, but that doesn\u2019t diminish their strong feelings for a cause that matches their ideals.\nLoyal to Their Values \u2013 Doing the right thing isn\u2019t always easy, but Mediators\u2019 far-reaching vision can help them stay the course. When they\u2019re doing something meaningful, these personalities can have a sense of purpose or even courage that keeps them true to their values.\nMediator (INFP) Weaknesses\nOverly Idealistic \u2013 Mediators can take their idealism too far. People with this personality type might idolize their romantic partner or expect every aspect of their job to feel meaningful. This can set them up for disappointment when reality falls short of their dreams.\nSelf-Critical \u2013 Mediators can expect so much from themselves that they inevitably fall short. When this happens, they may accuse themselves of being selfish or woefully inadequate. This self-criticism can erode their motivation to get things done and their willingness to prioritize necessary self-care.\nImpractical \u2013 When something captures Mediators\u2019 imagination, they can become so consumed by it that they neglect practical matters. Some people with this personality type even neglect eating or sleeping as they pursue their passion. Other Mediators can become so enamored with an idea that they\u2019re afraid to act on it because they might not do it perfectly.\nEmotionally Driven \u2013 Mediators can become so focused on their emotions that they lose track of what\u2019s really going on. It can be a challenge for these personalities to slow down and make sure that their feelings aren\u2019t preventing them from clearly seeing the facts of a situation.\nConflict-Averse \u2013 Mediators generally prefer to avoid conflict. They can put a great deal of time and energy into trying to please everyone. This desire to please others can drown out their own inner wisdom and make them painfully sensitive to even constructive criticism.\nDifficult to Get to Know \u2013 Mediators are private, reserved, and sometimes self-conscious. This can make them somewhat difficult to really get to know. Their need for personal space can contribute to the guilt they feel for not giving more of themselves to those they care about.\n02"

                "content": "Romantic Relationships\n\nMediators (INFPs) are dreamers and idealists, especially when it comes to romance. The concept of true love resonates with them, and they\u2019re unlikely to be happy in a relationship that is founded on anything less. People with this personality type may find themselves daydreaming about the perfect relationship, imagining how it would feel to share their innermost selves with another person.\n\nMost Mediators don\u2019t just want to find a partner \u2013 they want to connect with a soul mate. This idealism is among their most endearing traits. It\u2019s what enables Mediators to look past superficial appearances and remember what really matters \u2013 in love and in life.\n\nThat said, Mediator personalities need to make sure that they see their partners as they are \u2013 not as they want them to be. After all, no partner is perfect, and even the most beautiful of relationships has its challenges. With time, many Mediators come to learn that true love doesn\u2019t just magically happen \u2013 it takes compromise, understanding, and effort.\n\nHopelessly Devoted\n\nWhen they meet someone new, most Mediators can\u2019t help but compare that person with the ideal soul mate they\u2019ve imagined in the past. Unsurprisingly, this comparison tends to weed out more than a few potential partners. Not everyone can match Mediators\u2019 standards for morality and authenticity, and their idealized expectations might not be realistic. As a result, single Mediators may sometimes worry that they\u2019ll never find anyone who is a match for them.\n\nWhen they do find a kindred spirit, Mediators show themselves to be passionate, hopeless romantics. At the same time, they still respect their partner\u2019s independence. Mediator personalities use their compassion and insight to understand the people they care about, and they use their creativity to make their partner feel special.\n\nMediators share a sincere belief that two people can come together in a relationship and make each other better and happier than they were before.\n\nMost Mediators aim to accept their partners as they are. That said, these personalities also want to help their partners learn, grow, and pursue their goals. Mediators are always dreaming up ways to improve themselves and the world around them. The last thing they\u2019d want is for their partners to feel unhappy or stuck.\n\nAs a result, many people with this personality type dedicate themselves to helping their partners improve their lives. Although this is a noble goal, Mediators may need to be careful not to lose sight of their own needs and priorities. They might also need to make sure that their partners are really ready to change. As long as they do so, Mediators\u2019 support and devotion can make all the difference in their partners\u2019 lives.\n\nFinding What\u2019s Real\n\nMediators tend to avoid conflict whenever possible. This can help make their relationships stable, but it can also compromise the authenticity of their connection with their partners. These personalities may try to make their partners happy at all costs, sacrificing their own needs and preferences.\n\nMediators can also have a tendency to mentally fixate on problems in their relationships rather than discuss them openly. Because they don\u2019t want to trigger a conflict, they may find it difficult to talk about what\u2019s wrong and why. This can cause significant issues in their relationships. After all, their partners can\u2019t read their minds.\n\nPeople with this personality type may need to remind themselves that open, honest communication is necessary in a relationship, even if it isn\u2019t always easy. These moments of candor can transform a relationship for the better.\n\nAs long as they communicate openly, Mediators are more than capable of staying true to themselves in a relationship \u2013 and encouraging the person they love to do the same. By bringing their whole hearts and minds to their relationships, Mediators can find out what it truly means to love and be loved.\n\n03"

                "content": "Friendships\n\nMediators (INFPs) are among the most social of all Introverts, and they care about even their most casual acquaintances. That said, they\u2019re still Introverts. This means that they tend to feel most fulfilled by spending time with a small, intimate circle of friends. Acquaintances may come and go, but this inner circle is likely to include Mediators\u2019 friends for life.\n\nEarly in a friendship, Mediators may be somewhat reluctant to share their inner lives. They may try to draw out their new friend instead, learning more about that person\u2019s passions and motivations. As the friendship progresses, however, Mediator personalities can find it very meaningful to share their secret dreams and ideas with someone they know they can trust.\n\nThe Search for Kindred Spirits\n\nIn looking for potential friends, Mediators may find themselves drawn to people who remind them of themselves. Specifically, they may look for people who share their curiosity about human nature and their belief in doing the right thing. Among these kindred spirits, people with the Mediator personality type may feel accepted and understood in a way that helps them bloom in their own time.\n\nThat said, Mediators are capable of befriending all sorts of people. The combination of their Intuitive and Prospecting traits draws them to diverse perspectives, which helps them appreciate friends whose experiences and worldviews are totally different from their own. Mediator personalities may actually find it invigorating to connect with someone who, on the surface, has little in common with them.\n\nFor Mediators, a true friendship is founded on shared values, not just shared experiences. People with this personality type are unlikely to form strong friendships simply out of convenience. For example, while their affection for their coworkers may be strong, just working in the same office isn\u2019t enough for Mediators to guarantee a substantial friendship. Deeper connections must come into play.\n\nFriends for Life\n\nWhen Mediators befriend someone, they may secretly (or not so secretly) hope to be friends with that person for life. These personalities are capable of strong, stable friendships marked by passionate support, subtle poetic wit, and a profound level of emotional insight. Their friends will be rewarded with loving sensitivity and depth. A hallmark of this relationship is an ever-present desire to help, learn from, and understand each other.\n\nThat said, Mediators do need personal space and alone time in order to recharge. At times, people with this personality type may withdraw from even their closest friends in order to reconnect with themselves and restore their energy, as all Introverts must. These departures are usually temporary, but Mediators may need to make sure that their friends don\u2019t feel snubbed by their absence.\n\nEven as their friendships grow stronger and deeper, Mediators\u2019 enigmatic qualities never truly vanish.\n\nPeople with this personality type look for ways to improve their friendships and share their affection with those who matter to them. Often, this takes the form of spending quality time with their friends \u2013 coming up with big dreams for the future and indulging in deep conversations about all sorts of topics. But even when Mediators are entirely on their own, they always hold their friends in their hearts.\n\n04"

Few things give them more joy than bringing like-minded people on that journey with them. In their own understated way, Mediator personalities enjoy helping others learn and grow \u2013 and they can find a unique opportunity for this in parenthood.\n\nFrom the start, Mediator parents aim to be warm, loving, supportive, and open-minded. They delight in their children\u2019s wide-eyed wonder at the world. In general, people with this personality type want to give their children the freedom to form their own opinions and discover their own interests.\n\nMediators may enjoy raising free spirits, but that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re totally hands-off. They want to teach key values to their children, including honesty, compassion, and the importance of caring for others. They also want their children to understand the meaning of personal responsibility, especially when it comes to not hurting others.\n\nMediators never stop encouraging their children to learn and grow. These personalities use their sensitivity to communicate in ways that will resonate with their children.\nCoping with Challenges\n\nMediator parents want to serve as good role models. To do this, they often try to keep their problems, negative emotions, and frustrations from their children, preserving a sense of harmony in the household. This can help their children feel safe and cared for. Mediators may also try to shield their children from the greater problems in the world. This is certainly appropriate when their children are young, but eventually, Mediators will need to find ways to talk through tougher issues with their kids.\n\nLike parents of any personality type, Mediator parents inevitably face challenges. They take their parenting responsibilities seriously, so it can feel like a personal failure when their children misbehave in ways both large and small. They may be especially upset when they see their children behaving in ways that don\u2019t seem considerate or ethical. Discipline doesn\u2019t come easily to Mediator personalities, but at times, they may wonder if they should have been stricter or firmer.\n\nBalancing Structure with Spontaneity\n\nFor many Mediator parents, establishing practical, day-to-day structures and rules for their children can be a challenge. Fortunately, people with this personality type can use their creative energy to impose rules without stifling their children\u2019s curiosity and enthusiasm. By balancing structure with spontaneity, Mediator parents can help their children grow into their most caring, responsible, and joyful selves.\n\n05"

They want to spend their days doing something they genuinely love, preferably without too much stress or drama. For these personalities, an ideal professional life should feel like a calling, not just a job.\n\nAt times, idealistic Mediators might struggle to find a profession that meets their practical needs and fulfills their dreams. They may drift in frustration, waiting for the perfect job to present itself and eventually feeling stuck or worried that they\u2019re not living up to their potential. Alas, there\u2019s no such thing as a perfect job. The question of whether to settle for a less-than-ideal position can weigh heavily on people with this personality type.\n\nFortunately, Mediators stand out for their creativity, independence, and sincere desire to connect with and help others. These traits can help them shine \u2013 and find fulfillment \u2013 in nearly any line of work.\n\nThere\u2019s a Place for Everyone\n\nMediators can succeed nearly anywhere, but certain fields seem to be especially attractive to these personalities. With their curiosity and their love of self-expression, many Mediators dream of becoming writers. They might write novels, seek out interesting freelance niches, or even find themselves doing communications in a corporate field or for a nonprofit organization. Richly imaginative, Mediators can infuse even the driest of fundraising or marketing materials with new life.\n\nNearly any field can benefit from Mediators\u2019 artful communication style. As a result, Mediators may have their pick of jobs when choosing whether to work in the nonprofit or for-profit sphere \u2013 or for themselves.\n\nAlthough these personalities aren\u2019t known for seeking the spotlight, they may find their life\u2019s purpose in the performing arts. Mediators are sensitive to artistic beauty, and some of them simply come to life in the worlds of music, drama, or dance. These Mediators can draw from their inner depths to pull out exquisite interpretations of a creator\u2019s work. Many Mediators also create their own works as playwrights, composers, and choreographers.\n\nWhatever they do, people with this personality type want to feel that their work is helping others. As a result, some Mediators find it gratifying to work with clients face-to-face. Service careers, such as massage therapy, physical rehabilitation, counseling, social work, psychology, and even teaching can be exceptionally rewarding for Mediators, who take pride in the progress and growth that they help foster.\n\nPeople with this personality type tend to put others\u2019 interests ahead of their own. This is a mixed blessing, as it can make it hard for them to establish a healthy work-life balance. That said, few things are more rewarding for Mediators than seeing their work help change someone\u2019s life for the better.\n\nFinding Their Way\n\nMediators may find it demotivating to work in high-stress, bureaucratic, or hectic environments. They may also become frustrated by workplaces that are highly critical or competitive. Workplaces that reward independence tend to be a good fit for Mediators, although they may appreciate some structure and oversight to help them avoid procrastination and getting lost in thought.\n\nThat said, Mediators don\u2019t need ideal conditions to thrive professionally. These personalities want to live in tune with their values, in their careers as much as in any other aspect of their lives. As long as they feel a strong sense of mission in their work, they can put up with \u2013 and overcome \u2013 any number of challenges.\n\n06"

Wherever they find themselves on the job ladder, people with this personality type value harmony, and they try to find an emotional and moral connection to their work. These traits color how they respond to authority in the workplace as well as how they express it.\n\nMediator Subordinates\n\nMediators can be extremely dedicated and considerate employees. They take pride in being honest and doing the right thing in all circumstances. They also feel gratified by pleasing others, from their bosses to their customers. Mediator personalities feel most motivated when they\u2019re thinking up ways to help others, not worrying about checklists or bottom lines.\n\nThis explains why praise and positive feedback can make them light up. On the flip side, criticism can lead Mediators to shut down. When faced with punishing expectations or a highly negative boss, they may find it hard to get things done.\n\nAs employees, Mediators enjoy having freedom and latitude. They like to use their creativity rather than just do as they\u2019re told. That said, they tend to benefit from deadlines and clear expectations to keep them on track. Otherwise, people with this personality type might get caught up in perfecting their ideas rather than accomplishing tasks.\n\nMediator Colleagues\n\nMediator personalities generally don\u2019t enjoy hierarchies. They like to promote equality in the workplace, and their ideal professional environment is one where everyone feels valued and is encouraged to share their ideas. As colleagues, Mediators do what they can to make this ideal a reality.\n\nMediators can be private, so they\u2019re probably not the social butterflies of their workplace. That said, they tend to be pleasant and kindhearted colleagues, and they can be quite friendly. Mediators don\u2019t like conflict, drama, or workplace politics. Instead, they try to act in ways that foster harmony and cooperation. When one of their coworkers needs help, Mediators will often pitch in without any expectation of praise or recognition.\n\nOne of Mediators\u2019 greatest contributions as colleagues is their empathetic communication style. These personalities speak in a way that\u2019s honest but kind, which can set a positive tone for the entire workplace.\n\nMediator Managers\n\nAs managers, Mediators are among the personality types least likely to act as if they\u2019re in charge. They respect their employees as full-fledged human beings, not just as workers. Rather than make all the decisions themselves, they often ask to hear their employees\u2019 thoughts and opinions.\n\nIn general, people with this personality type don\u2019t micromanage. Instead, they keep their eyes on the big picture. They see it as their responsibility to support their employees, not to tell them exactly what to do and how to do it. Whenever possible, they encourage the people who work for them to develop their own ideas and use their own best judgment.\n\nThere is a downside to this management style. Sometimes Mediators may struggle to set boundaries, drill down on inefficiencies, or offer criticism, even when it\u2019s necessary. This can slow down their team and create needless stress, both for Mediators and for their employees. At times, managers with this personality type may need to be strict for the good of their team.\n\n07"

Protagonists easily see people\u2019s motivations and seemingly disconnected events, and are able to bring these ideas together and communicate them as a common goal with an eloquence that is nothing short of mesmerizing.\n\nThe interest Protagonists have in others is genuine, almost to a fault \u2013 when they believe in someone, they can become too involved in the other person\u2019s problems, place too much trust in them. Luckily, this trust tends to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Protagonists\u2019 altruism and authenticity inspire those they care about to become better themselves. But if they aren\u2019t careful, they can overextend their optimism, sometimes pushing others further than they\u2019re ready or willing to go.\n\nProtagonists are vulnerable to another snare as well: they have a tremendous capacity for reflecting on and analyzing their own feelings, but if they get too caught up in another person\u2019s plight, they can develop a sort of emotional hypochondria, seeing other people\u2019s problems in themselves, trying to fix something in themselves that isn\u2019t wrong. If they get to a point where they are held back by limitations someone else is experiencing, it can hinder Protagonists\u2019 ability to see past the dilemma and be of any help at all. When this happens, it\u2019s important for Protagonists to pull back and use that self-reflection to distinguish between what they really feel, and what is a separate issue that needs to be looked at from another perspective.\n\n...The Struggle Ought Not to Deter Us From the Support of a Cause We Believe to Be Just\nProtagonists are genuine, caring people who talk the talk and walk the walk, and nothing makes them happier than leading the charge, uniting and motivating their team with infectious enthusiasm.\n\nPeople with the Protagonist personality type are passionate altruists, sometimes even to a fault, and they are unlikely to be afraid to take the slings and arrows while standing up for the people and ideas they believe in. It is no wonder that many famous Protagonists are cultural or political icons \u2013 this personality type wants to lead the way to a brighter future, whether it\u2019s by leading a nation to prosperity, or leading their little league softball team to a hard-fought victory.\n\n01",

                "content": "Strengths & Weaknesses\nProtagonist Strengths\nTolerant \u2013 Protagonists are true team players, and they recognize that that means listening to other peoples\u2019 opinions, even when they contradict their own. They admit they don\u2019t have all the answers, and are often receptive to dissent, so long as it remains constructive.\nReliable \u2013 The one thing that galls Protagonists the most is the idea of letting down a person or cause they believe in. If it\u2019s possible, Protagonists can always be counted on to see it through.\nCharismatic \u2013 Charm and popularity are qualities Protagonists have in spades. They instinctively know how to capture an audience, and pick up on mood and motivation in ways that allow them to communicate with reason, emotion, passion, restraint \u2013 whatever the situation calls for. Talented imitators, Protagonists are able to shift their tone and manner to reflect the needs of the audience, while still maintaining their own voice.\nAltruistic \u2013 Uniting these qualities is Protagonists\u2019 unyielding desire to do good in and for their communities, be it in their own home or the global stage. Warm and selfless, Protagonists genuinely believe that if they can just bring people together, they can do a world of good.\nNatural Leaders \u2013 More than seeking authority themselves, Protagonists often end up in leadership roles at the request of others, cheered on by the many admirers of their strong personality and positive vision.\nProtagonist Weaknesses\nOverly Idealistic \u2013 People with the Protagonist personality type can be caught off guard as they find that, through circumstance or nature, or simple misunderstanding, people fight against them and defy the principles they\u2019ve adopted, however well-intentioned they may be. They are more likely to feel pity for this opposition than anger, and can earn a reputation of na\u00efvet\u00e9.\nToo Selfless \u2013 Protagonists can bury themselves in their hopeful promises, feeling others\u2019 problems as their own and striving hard to meet their word. If they aren\u2019t careful, they can spread themselves too thin, and be left unable to help anyone.\nToo Sensitive \u2013 While receptive to criticism, seeing it as a tool for leading a better team, it\u2019s easy for Protagonists to take it a little too much to heart. Their sensitivity to others means that Protagonists sometimes feel problems that aren\u2019t their own and try to fix things they can\u2019t fix, worrying if they are doing enough.\nFluctuating Self-Esteem \u2013 Protagonists define their self-esteem by whether they are able to live up to their ideals, and sometimes ask for criticism more out of insecurity than out of confidence, always wondering what they could do better. If they fail to meet a goal or to help someone they said they\u2019d help, their self-confidence will undoubtedly plummet.\nStruggle to Make Tough Decisions \u2013 If caught between a rock and a hard place, Protagonists can be stricken with paralysis, imagining all the consequences of their actions, especially if those consequences are humanitarian.\n02"

                "content": "Romantic Relationships\n\nPeople who share the Protagonist personality type feel most at home when they are in a relationship, and few types are more eager to establish a loving commitment with their chosen partners. Protagonists take dating and relationships seriously, selecting partners with an eye towards the long haul, rather than the more casual approach that might be expected from some types in the Explorer Role group. There\u2019s really no greater joy for Protagonists than to help along the goals of someone they care about, and the interweaving of lives that a committed relationship represents is the perfect opportunity to do just that.\n\nI\u2019m a Slow Walker, but I Never Walk Back\nEven in the dating phase, people with the Protagonist personality type are ready to show their commitment by taking the time and effort to establish themselves as dependable, trustworthy partners.\n\nTheir Intuitive (N) trait helps them to keep up with the rapidly shifting moods that are common early in relationships, but Protagonists will still rely on conversations about their mutual feelings, checking the pulse of the relationship by asking how things are, and if there\u2019s anything else they can do. While this can help to keep conflict, which Protagonists abhor, to a minimum, they also risk being overbearing or needy \u2013 Protagonists should keep in mind that sometimes the only thing that\u2019s wrong is being asked what\u2019s wrong too often.\n\nProtagonists don\u2019t need much to be happy, just to know that their partner is happy, and for their partner to express that happiness through visible affection. Making others\u2019 goals come to fruition is often the chiefest concern of Protagonists, and they will spare no effort in helping their partner to live the dream. If they aren\u2019t careful though, Protagonists\u2019 quest for their partners\u2019 satisfaction can leave them neglecting their own needs, and it\u2019s important for them to remember to express those needs on occasion, especially early on.\n\nYou Cannot Escape the Responsibility of Tomorrow by Evading It Today\n\nProtagonists\u2019 tendency to avoid any kind of conflict, sometimes even sacrificing their own principles to keep the peace, can lead to long-term problems if these efforts never fully resolve the underlying issues that they mask. On the other hand, people with the Protagonist personality type can sometimes be too preemptive in resolving their conflicts, asking for criticisms and suggestions in ways that convey neediness or insecurity. Protagonists invest their emotions wholly in their relationships, and are sometimes so eager to please that it actually undermines the relationship \u2013 this can lead to resentment, and even the failure of the relationship. When this happens, Protagonists experience strong senses of guilt and betrayal, as they see all their efforts slip away.\n\nIf potential partners appreciate these qualities though, and make an effort themselves to look after the needs of their Protagonist partners, they will enjoy long, happy, passionate relationships. Protagonists are known to be dependable lovers, perhaps more interested in routine and stability than spontaneity in their sex lives, but always dedicated to the selfless satisfaction of their partners. Ultimately, Protagonist personality types believe that the only true happiness is mutual happiness, and that\u2019s the stuff successful relationships are made of.\n\n03"

While some personality types may accept the circumstantial highs and lows of friendship, their feelings waxing and waning with the times, Protagonists will put active effort into maintaining these connections, viewing them as substantial and important, not something to let slip away through laziness or inattention.\n\nThis philosophy of genuine connection is core to the Protagonist personality type, and while it is visible in the workplace and in romance, it is clearest in the breadth and depth of Protagonist friendships.\nAll My Life I Have Tried to Pluck a Thistle and Plant a Flower Wherever the Flower Would Grow...\n\nPeople with the Protagonist personality type take genuine pleasure in getting to know other people, and have no trouble talking with people of all types and modes of thought. Even in disagreement, other perspectives are fascinating to Protagonists \u2013 though like most people, they connect best with individuals who share their principles and ideals, and types in Diplomat and Analyst Role groups are best able to explore Protagonists\u2019 viewpoints with them, which are simply too idealistic for most. It is with these closest friends that Protagonists will truly open up, keeping their many other connections in a realm of lighthearted but genuine support and encouragement.\n\nOthers truly value their Protagonist friends, appreciating the warmth, kindness, and sincere optimism and cheer they bring to the table. Protagonists want to be the best friends possible, and it shows in how they work to find out not just the superficial interests of their friends, but their strengths, passions, hopes and dreams. Nothing makes Protagonists happier than to see the people they care about do well, and they are more than happy to take their own time and energy to help make it happen.\n\nWe Should Be Too Big to Take Offense, and Too Noble to Give It\n\nWhile Protagonists enjoy lending this helping hand, other personality types may simply not have the energy or drive to keep up with it \u2013 creating further strain, people with the Protagonist personality type can become offended if their efforts aren\u2019t reciprocated when the opportunity arises. Ultimately, Protagonists\u2019 give and take can become stifling to types who are more interested in the moment than the future, or who simply have Identities that rest firmly on the Assertive side, making them content with who they are and uninterested in the sort of self-improvement and goal-setting that Protagonists hold so dear.\n\nWhen this happens Protagonist personalities can be critical, if they believe it necessary. While usually tactful and often helpful, if their friend is already annoyed by Protagonists\u2019 attempts to push them forward, it can simply cause them to dig in their heels further. Protagonists should try to avoid taking this personally when it happens, and relax their inflexibility into an occasional \u201clive and let live\u201d attitude.\n\nUltimately though, Protagonists will find that their excitement and unyielding optimism will yield them many satisfying relationships with people who appreciate and share their vision and authenticity. The joy Protagonists take in moving things forward means that there is always a sense of purpose behind their friendships, creating bonds that are not easily shaken.\n\n04"

If there\u2019s one strong trend with the Protagonist personality type, it\u2019s that they are a bedrock of empathetic support, not bullheadedly telling people what they ought to do, but helping them to explore their options and encouraging them to follow their hearts.\n\nProtagonist parents will encourage their children to explore and grow, recognizing and appreciating the individuality of the people they bring into this world and help to raise.\nWhatever You Are, Be a Good One\n\nProtagonist parents take pride in nurturing and inspiring strong values, and they take care to ensure that the basis for these values comes from understanding, not blind obedience. Whatever their children need in order to learn and grow, Protagonist parents give the time and energy necessary to provide it. While in their weaker moments they may succumb to more manipulative behavior, Protagonists mostly rely on their charm and idealism to make sure their children take these lessons to heart.\n\nOwing to their aversion to conflict, Protagonist parents strive to ensure that their homes provide a safe and conflict-free environment. While they can deliver criticism, it\u2019s not Protagonists\u2019 strong suit, and laying down the occasionally necessary discipline won\u2019t come naturally. But, people with the Protagonist personality type have high standards for their children, encouraging them to be the best they can be, and when these confrontations do happen, they try to frame the lessons as archetypes, moral constants in life which they hope their children will embrace.\n\nAs their children enter adolescence, they begin to truly make their own decisions, sometimes contrary to what their parents want \u2013 while Protagonists will do their best to meet this with grace and humor, they can feel hurt, and even unloved, in the face of this rebellion. Protagonists are sensitive, and if their child goes so far as to launch into criticisms, they may become truly upset, digging in their heels and locking horns.\n\nAll That I Am, or Hope to Be, I Owe to My Angel Mother\n\nLuckily, these occasions will likely be rare. Protagonists\u2019 intuition gives them a talent for understanding, and regardless of the heat of the moment, their children will move on, remembering the genuine warmth, care, love and encouragement they\u2019ve always received from their Protagonist parents. They grow up feeling the lessons that have been woven into the fabric of their character, and recognize that they are the better for their parents\u2019 efforts.\n\n05"

Lucky for them, people like being helped, and are even willing to pay for it, which means that Protagonists are rarely wanting for inspiration and opportunity in their search for meaningful work.\n\nDon\u2019t Worry When You Are Not Recognized, but Strive to Be Worthy of Recognition\n\nProtagonists take a genuine interest in other people, approaching them with warm sociability and a helpful earnestness that rarely goes unnoticed. Altruistic careers like social and religious work, teaching, counseling, and advising of all sorts are popular avenues, giving people with the Protagonist personality type a chance to help others learn, grow, and become more independent. This attitude, alongside their social skills, emotional intelligence and tendency to be \u201cthat person who knows everybody\u201d, can be adapted to quite a range of other careers as well, making Protagonists natural HR administrators, event coordinators, and politicians \u2013 anything that helps a community or organization to operate more smoothly.\n\nTo top it all off, Protagonists are able to express themselves both creatively and honestly, allowing them to approach positions as sales representatives and advertising consultants from a certain idealistic perspective, intuitively picking up on the needs and wants of their customers, and working to make them happier. However, Protagonists need to make sure they get to focus on people, not systems and spreadsheets, and they are unlikely to have the stomach for making the sort of decisions required in corporate governance positions \u2013 they will feel haunted, knowing that their decision cost someone their job, or that their product cost someone their life.\n\nHaving a preference for Intuitive (N) trait over its Observant (S) counterpart also means that careers demanding exceptional situational awareness, such as law enforcement, military service, and emergency response, will cause Protagonists to burn out quickly. While great at organizing willing parties and winning over skeptics, in dangerous situations Protagonists just won\u2019t be able to maintain the sort of focus on their immediate physical surroundings that they inevitably demand of themselves hour after hour, day after day.\n\nAlways Bear in Mind That Your Own Resolution to Succeed Is More Important Than Any Other\n\nIt makes a great deal more sense for Protagonists to be the force keeping these vital services organized and running well, taking their long-term views, people skills and idealism, and using them to shape the situation on the ground, while more physical personality types manage the moment-to-moment crises. People with the Protagonist personality type are always up for a good challenge \u2013 and nothing thrills them quite like helping others. But while willing to train the necessary skills, Protagonists will always show an underlying preference for the sort of help that draws a positive long-term trend, that effects change that really sticks.\n\nAt the heart of it, Protagonists need to see how the story ends, to feel and experience the gratitude and appreciation of the people they\u2019ve helped in order to be happy.\n\nCareers operating behind enemy lines and arriving at the scene of the crime too late to help will simply weigh on Protagonists\u2019 sensitive hearts and minds, especially if criticized despite their efforts. On the other hand, Protagonists are a driven, versatile group, and that same vision that pulls them towards administration and politics can help them focus through the stress of the moment, knowing that each second of effort contributes to something bigger than themselves.\n\n06"

With this wind at their backs, Protagonists are able to thrive in many diverse roles, at any level of seniority. Moreover, they are simply likeable people, and this quality propels them to success wherever they have a chance to work with others.\n\nProtagonist Subordinates\n\nAs subordinates, Protagonists will often underestimate themselves \u2013 nevertheless, they quickly make an impression on their managers. Quick learners and excellent multitaskers, people with the Protagonist personality type are able to take on multiple responsibilities with competence and good cheer. Protagonists are hardworking, reliable and eager to help \u2013 but this can all be a double-edged sword, as some managers will take advantage of Protagonists\u2019 excellent quality of character by making too many requests and overburdening their Protagonist subordinates with extra work. Protagonists are conflict-averse and try to avoid unnecessary criticism, and in all likelihood will accept these extra tasks in an attempt to maintain a positive impression and frictionless environment.\n\nProtagonist Colleagues\n\nAs colleagues, Protagonists\u2019 desire to assist and cooperate is even more evident as they draw their coworkers into teams where everyone can feel comfortable expressing their opinions and suggestions, working together to develop win-win situations that get the job done. Protagonists\u2019 tolerance, open-mindedness and easy sociability make it easy for them to relate to their colleagues, but also make it perhaps a little too easy for their colleagues to shift their problems onto Protagonists\u2019 plates. People with the Protagonist personality type are sensitive to the needs of others, and their role as a social nexus means that problems inevitably find their way to Protagonists\u2019 doorsteps, where colleagues will find a willing, if overburdened, associate.\n\nProtagonist Managers\n\nWhile perfectly capable as subordinates and colleagues, Protagonists\u2019 true calling, where their capacity for insightful and inspiring communication and sensitivity to the needs of others really shows, is in managing teams. As managers, Protagonists combine their skill in recognizing individual motivations with their natural charisma to not only push their teams and projects forward, but to make their teams want to push forward. They may sometimes stoop to manipulation, the alternative often being a more direct confrontation, but Protagonists\u2019 end goal is always to get done what they set out to do in a way that leaves everyone involved satisfied with their roles and the results they achieved together.\n\n07"

These people tend to embrace big ideas and actions that reflect their sense of hope and goodwill toward others. Their vibrant energy can flow in many directions.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for \u2013 and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart\u2019s longing. It doesn\u2019t interest me how old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool \u2013 for love \u2013 for your dreams \u2013 for the adventure of being alive.\n\nORIAH MOUNTAIN DREAMER\n\nThe Campaigner personality is a true free spirit. They are often the life of the party, but unlike types in the Explorer Role group, Campaigners are less interested in the sheer excitement and pleasure of the moment than they are in enjoying the social and emotional connections they make with others. Charming, independent, energetic and compassionate, the 7% of the population that they comprise can certainly be felt in any crowd.\n\nYou Can Change the World With Just an Idea\n\nMore than just sociable people-pleasers though, Campaigners, like all their Diplomat cousins, are shaped by their Intuitive (N) quality, allowing them to read between the lines with curiosity and energy. They tend to see life as a big, complex puzzle where everything is connected \u2013 but unlike Analyst personality types, who tend to see that puzzle as a series of systemic machinations, Campaigners see it through a prism of emotion, compassion and mysticism, and are always looking for a deeper meaning.\n\nCampaigners are fiercely independent, and much more than stability and security, they crave creativity and freedom.\n\nMany other types are likely to find these qualities irresistible, and if they\u2019ve found a cause that sparks their imagination, Campaigners will bring an energy that oftentimes thrusts them into the spotlight, held up by their peers as a leader and a guru \u2013 but this isn\u2019t always where independence-loving Campaigners want to be. Worse still if they find themselves beset by the administrative tasks and routine maintenance that can accompany a leadership position. Campaigners\u2019 self-esteem is dependent on their ability to come up with original solutions, and they need to know that they have the freedom to be innovative \u2013 they can quickly lose patience or become dejected if they get trapped in a boring role.\n\nDon\u2019t Lose That \u2019Little Spark of Madness\u2019\n\nLuckily, Campaigners know how to relax, and they are perfectly capable of switching from a passionate, driven idealist in the workplace to that imaginative and enthusiastic free spirit on the dance floor, often with a suddenness that can surprise even their closest friends. Being in the mix also gives them a chance to connect emotionally with others, giving them cherished insight into what motivates their friends and colleagues. They believe that everyone should take the time to recognize and express their feelings, and their empathy and sociability make that a natural conversation topic.\n\nThe Campaigner personality type needs to be careful, however \u2013 if they rely too much on their intuition, assume or anticipate too much about a friend\u2019s motivations, they can misread the signals and frustrate plans that a more straightforward approach would have made simple. This kind of social stress is the bugbear that keeps harmony-focused Diplomats awake at night. Campaigners are very emotional and sensitive, and when they step on someone\u2019s toes, they both feel it.\n\nCampaigners will spend a lot of time exploring social relationships, feelings and ideas before they find something that really rings true. But when they finally do find their place in the world, their imagination, empathy and courage are likely to produce incredible results.\n\n01",

                "content": "Strengths & Weaknesses\nCampaigner Strengths\nCurious \u2013 When it comes to new ideas, Campaigners aren\u2019t interested in brooding \u2013 they want to go out and experience things, and don\u2019t hesitate to step out of their comfort zones to do so. Campaigners are imaginative and open-minded, seeing all things as part of a big, mysterious puzzle called life.\nObservant \u2013 Campaigners believe that there are no irrelevant actions, that every shift in sentiment, every move and every idea is part of something bigger. To satisfy their curiosity, Campaigners try to notice all of these things, and to never miss a moment.\nEnergetic and Enthusiastic \u2013 As they observe, forming new connections and ideas, Campaigners won\u2019t hold their tongues \u2013 they\u2019re excited about their findings, and share them with anyone who\u2019ll listen. This infectious enthusiasm has the dual benefit of giving Campaigners a chance to make more social connections, and of giving them a new source of information and experience, as they fit their new friends\u2019 opinions into their existing ideas.\nExcellent Communicators \u2013 It\u2019s a good thing that Campaigners have such strong people skills, or they\u2019d never express these ideas. Campaigners enjoy both small talk and deep, meaningful conversations, which are just two sides of the same coin for them, and are adept at steering conversations towards their desired subjects in ways that feel completely natural and unforced.\nKnow How to Relax \u2013 It\u2019s not all \u201cnature of the cosmos\u201d discussions with Campaigners \u2013 people with this personality type know that sometimes, nothing is as important as simply having fun and experiencing life\u2019s joys. That Intuitive trait lets Campaigners know that it\u2019s time to shake things up, and these wild bursts of enthusiastic energy can surprise even their closest friends.\nVery Popular and Friendly \u2013 All this adaptability and spontaneity comes together to form a person who is approachable, interesting and exciting, with a cooperative and altruistic spirit and friendly, empathetic disposition. Campaigners get along with pretty much everyone, and their circles of friends stretch far and wide.\nCampaigner Weaknesses\nPoor Practical Skills \u2013 When it comes to conceiving ideas and starting projects, especially involving other people, Campaigners have exceptional talent. Unfortunately their skill with upkeep, administration, and follow-through on those projects struggles. Without more hands-on people to help push day-to-day things along, Campaigners\u2019 ideas are likely to remain just that \u2013 ideas.\nFind it Difficult to Focus \u2013 Campaigners are natural explorers of interpersonal connections and philosophy, but this backfires when what needs to be done is that TPS report sitting right in front of them. It\u2019s hard for Campaigners to maintain interest as tasks drift towards routine, administrative matters, and away from broader concepts.\nOverthink Things \u2013 Campaigners don\u2019t take things at face value \u2013 they look for underlying motives in even the simplest things. It\u2019s not uncommon for Campaigners to lose a bit of sleep asking themselves why someone did what they did, what it might mean, and what to do about it.\nGet Stressed Easily \u2013 All this overthinking isn\u2019t just for their own benefit \u2013 Campaigners, especially Turbulent ones, are very sensitive, and care deeply about others\u2019 feelings. A consequence of their popularity is that others often look to them for guidance and help, which takes time, and it\u2019s easy to see why Campaigners sometimes get overwhelmed, especially when they can\u2019t say yes to every request.\nHighly Emotional \u2013 While emotional expression is healthy and natural, with Campaigners even viewing it as a core part of their identity, it can come out strongly enough to cause problems for this personality type. Particularly when under stress, criticism or conflict, Campaigners can experience emotional bursts that are counter-productive at best.\nIndependent to a Fault \u2013 Campaigners loathe being micromanaged and restrained by heavy-handed rules \u2013 they want to be seen as highly independent masters of their own fates, even possessors of an altruistic wisdom that goes beyond draconian law. The challenge for Campaigners is that they live in a world of checks and balances, a pill they are not happy to swallow.\n02"

                "content": "Romantic Relationships\n\nWhen it comes to relationships, there\u2019s hardly anyone around who is more excited than Campaigners to share with their partners the bounty of ideas and eye-opening experiences that life has to offer. For people with the Campaigner personality type, relationships are a joyous process of mutual exploration and imagination, a chance to connect with another soul. Campaigners take their relationships seriously, and are known for their uninhibited and unshakeable devotion to the people to whom they\u2019ve committed their hearts.\n\nCampaigners have the advantage of irresistible charm when it comes to attracting a partner \u2013 Campaigners\u2019 warmth, excitement and passion are simply alluring.\n\nIn the dating phase, if Campaigners can be said to tolerate such a formal process to begin with, they will show these qualities by showering their new flames with affection, and will do everything they can to build a strong relationship by demonstrating their devotion and reliability by whatever means available.\n\nYou Cannot Live Without a Fire\n\nLong-distance relationships are quite common among Campaigners, as they view physical distance as just another idea, no match for concepts like love. This gives them the chance to demonstrate their commitment, both by staying true despite the physical separation, and with overtures of effort to surprise their partners, crossing that distance on a whim. These are demonstrations of Campaigners\u2019 mystery, idealism and deep emotion, and such efforts often keep the flames of a relationship burning bright.\n\nPeople with the Campaigner personality type express these ideals sexually as well, exploring the physical with imagination and passion, viewing these times together as a chance to let their feelings for each other shine, sharing their love and affection. Campaigners will willingly experiment with their partners, even early in a relationship, but they can also be oddly perfectionistic, believing that these physical acts are a representation of their deeper love, and as such should not be performed carelessly. This perfectionism is also a reflection of their sensitivity, their desire to not disappoint, and Campaigners appreciate a well-placed compliment.\n\nNot everyone can handle the excitement, occasional neediness, and emotional ups and downs that this philosophy entails, whether long-distance or long-term, mystical or physical. Campaigners constantly explore new ideas and improvements, fantasize about future possibilities \u2013 in dating, this tendency to look at potential rather than the present can be self-defeating, and their spontaneity makes it harder to stay focused on their end goal of a long-term relationship. If their partners aren\u2019t able to reciprocate these acts of excitement and devotion, Campaigners will likely end up feeling unhappy and misunderstood.\n\nSo, You Think You Know the Real Me?\n\nCampaigners go all-in with their relationships, and if they fall apart despite their efforts, they can end up plagued with questions about why the relationship failed and what they could have done differently \u2013 without a buoy, these thoughts can crush Campaigners\u2019 self-esteem as they sink into depression. It\u2019s important for Campaigner personalities, as with anyone, to remember that relationships are in all ways mutual \u2013 mutual interest, mutual growth, and mutual responsibility \u2013 and they can\u2019t be solely accountable.\n\nAfter a trial like this, Campaigners may be reluctant to open up and commit, and it can take years for a partner to navigate their bewildering depth and intensity, falsely believing that Campaigners\u2019 enthusiasm and apparent openness means that they wear everything on their sleeves. The reality is that Campaigners\u2019 spontaneity, the seeming inconsistency and erraticism the untrained eye sees, isn\u2019t a product of flightiness or lack of depth, but the opposite \u2013 it is a drive to express ideas about a mystical, all-encompassing energy, in the confines of a physical world, and underlying it all is the uniting principle of love, expressed in many different ways, but unshakeable and infinite at its core.\n\n03"

This warmth and sincerity makes people with the Campaigner personality type masters of drawing people out of their shells, and as a result they tend to have a huge circle of friends.\n\nAs with other relationships, Campaigners view their friendships as opportunities to experience another angle of the universe, and tend to imbue potential friendships with that weighty and idealistic quality.\nAn Exciting Adventure\n\nMore outgoing types will naturally gravitate towards them, but Campaigners will also go to great lengths and be surprisingly persistent in their efforts to get to know more reserved personalities. Their ability to tune into others and speak their language with that characteristic infectious enthusiasm helps them in this endeavor, and the allure of mystery that reserved types, especially Introverted Intuitives, bring to the table will keep Campaigners intrigued for years. These personality types may never be able to reciprocate the breadth of human interest that Campaigners present, but they do appreciate Campaigners\u2019 efforts.\n\nBut Campaigners\u2019 interest in others can be a double-edged sword \u2013 this pure idealism comes with certain expectations, and too often Campaigners hold their friends in an unrealistic light, expecting them to keep up with the constant flow of ideas and experiences that they consider integral to life. Campaigners put their whole hearts into their friendships, and it can come as a shock for them to find that their friends aren\u2019t the flawless Titans that they believed them to be. Whether it\u2019s simple social fatigue or a focus on the physical and the practical instead of the mystical, people with the Campaigner personality type can find themselves disappointed by what they see as a lack of substance beneath the surface.\n\nCampaigners tend to get deeply involved in others\u2019 lives, going to great lengths and efforts to be the selfless, caring and supportive people they are, and all the while forget to take care of themselves. Both in terms of basic needs like financial stability and rest, as well as more emotional needs like mutual understanding and reciprocation, Campaigner personalities tend to give much more of themselves than most are even capable of giving back. This sort of imbalance isn\u2019t sustainable, as (seemingly) one-sided generosity often leads to criticism and resentment on both sides.\n\nMaking Life Spectacular\n\nLuckily, Campaigners are open-minded and sincere enough in their friendships, and connect with and understand even their acquaintances well enough, that they recognize that not everyone expresses themselves in the same ways, and that that\u2019s okay. Their sensitivity may make it too challenging to play with more critical and argumentative personalities, such as strongly expressed Thinking (T) and Judging (J) types, but they do appreciate, even cherish, the company of most anyone who appreciates theirs, and the adventures and experiences they have together are the stuff a good life is made of.\n\n04"

Throughout their children\u2019s lives, Campaigners provide a combination of almost overwhelming love and support, and an unstructured environment revolving around freedom and creativity. This in no way means that people with the Campaigner personality type will simply leave their children to their own devices without guidance \u2013 rather, Campaigner parents want to share in their children\u2019s perspective, share in a world without bounds.\n\nCampaigner parents are playful and warm, and love to see their children excited, playing in and experimenting with the world around them. It is likely that Campaigner parents will encourage this play and growth by suggesting activities and lessons.\n\nCampaigners will embrace and encourage productive interests as they arise, sweeping away dolls and dinosaurs when interests shift to the oceans, and sweeping away the fish when tastes change again, to the stars.\n\nWhile they often enough recognize the value of structure and predictability, Campaigner parents are unlikely to have the heart (or as they may see it, the lack of heart) to establish these limitations themselves. They may need to depend on their partners to provide some necessary guidelines and discipline from time to time, but Campaigner parents will always have the advantage of their open-minded and empathetic nature, making them not just parents, but friends who their children feel comfortable confiding in. They needn\u2019t always depend on their children broaching the subject either, as Campaigners have a natural skill in spotting emotional disharmony or physical discomfort in others.\n\nGo On, Spread Your Wings\n\nAs their children approach the teenage years, all this emotion and attention can start to cloy, and their children may seek a more private independence. This can be a challenge for people with the Campaigner personality type \u2013 they have strong emotions, and invest those emotions heavily in the things and people they care about. While they may not be big on using proven ideas, Campaigners do like to see whether or not their ideas work, and this applies to their thoughts on parenting, too. As their adolescent children withdraw, they leave an unsolved mystery that can last for years, leaving their Campaigner parents wondering if their ideas on raising their children actually work, actually result in happy, independent and creative adults.\n\nLuckily for them, so long as they raise their children with a sense of productive independence, rather than an aimless, against-the-grain antipathy, Campaigners will find that their children have developed a strong sense of self and self-worth, going confidently out into the big, wide world at their own pace and in their own style, knowing that they have both themselves and their Campaigner parents to depend on.\n\n05"

Campaigners are fascinated by new ideas, both in terms of developments in fields they are already familiar with, and when new subjects come along. The trick for people with the Campaigner personality type is to take advantage of this quality, this wonder with the magnificent breadth and detail in the world, and to use it to propel themselves further and deeper than others are willing or able to go.\n\nIf there\u2019s a challenge Campaigners face when selecting a career, it isn\u2019t that they lack talent or options or drive, it\u2019s that there are so many things out there that are just cool.\nThe Opening of a Door Can Be a Wonderfully Joyous Moment\n\nChief among Campaigners\u2019 talents is their people skills, a quality that is even more valuable now than ever. Even in traditional Analyst strongholds like engineering, systems analysis and the sciences, Campaigners\u2019 ability to network and match the communication styles of their audience means that even as they explore new challenges on their own, they will be able to work with others, explore others\u2019 perspectives and glean new insights into their projects. Much of modern progress stems from incorporating other studies into typically disassociated fields, and no one is better equipped to merge broad interests than talented, energetic and future-minded Campaigners.\n\nAnd while Thinking types may be better at applying logic to systems and machines, people with the Campaigner personality type are able to apply that same logic to human interactions and networks, using their exceptional social perception to find out what makes people tick. This lends Campaigners a solid foothold in any human science or service, from psychology, counseling and teaching to politics, diplomacy and detective work. All of these fields have another important similarity: they are in constant development, shifting, presenting new angles and new approaches. It\u2019s simply not possible to be good in these fields and content with the way things are, and this is where Campaigners truly shine.\n\nToo Many Bosses, Too Few Workers\n\nWhere Campaigners do not shine is in systems of strict regimentation and hierarchy, such as military service. Campaigners thrive on the ability to question the status quo and explore the alternatives, and if this is a quality that is not just unappreciated but actually frowned upon, this will not only make them unhappy, but it may even threaten their emotional stability. Repetition, predictability, boredom\u2026 while some Sentinel types may appreciate predictability and clear hierarchies, these are not selling points for Campaigners. People with the Campaigner personality type need to feel like they\u2019re pushing boundaries and exploring ideas, and should focus on interests and careers that encourage that.\n\nMany more career options satisfy these needs, and not just the scientific ones \u2013 writing, journalism, acting and TV reporting all give Campaigners a chance to explore something new every day and stir the pot a little while they\u2019re at it. It may come to pass though, that the best way forward for Campaigner personalities is to establish themselves as entrepreneurs and consultants, blazing their own trails and taking on whatever project is most fascinating. So long as they get to use their people skills, identify and achieve their own goals and inspire their colleagues and followers, Campaigners will be happy.\n\n06"

                "content": "Workplace Habits\n\nThere are two basic things that Campaigners seek most in the workplace: The chance to explore new ideas, and the chance to conduct that exploration alongside other people who share their excitement. These qualities show through at all levels of hierarchy, though much like other Diplomat personality types, Campaigners would prefer that there be hardly a hierarchy at all. People with the Campaigner personality type possess warmth, creativity, and an open-mindedness that makes them excellent listeners. If these qualities are recognized by their employers, they will always be able to count on their Campaigner employees to innovate and boost morale.\n\nCampaigner Subordinates\n\nCampaigners are growth-oriented, and as subordinates they\u2019ll impress their managers with their creativity and adaptability. People with the Campaigner personality type are excellent listeners, able to analyze and understand others\u2019 perspectives effortlessly. It\u2019s perhaps this quality that most makes Campaigners intolerant of micromanagement \u2013 the way they see it, they understand what\u2019s been asked of them, and all they require is the freedom to accomplish their task. If this need isn\u2019t met, managers may find a quickly stressed Campaigner subordinate.\n\nTo a certain extent though, some direct management is often necessary, as Campaigners are notorious for letting their attention slip from one project to the next before they\u2019ve dotted their I\u2019s and crossed their T\u2019s. Campaigners love exploring new ideas and learning new things, and once something becomes familiar, its allure starts to fade. But, if managers are able to maintain a spirit of guidance and camaraderie instead of \"bossiness\", they will find loyal and devoted contributors in their Campaigner subordinates.\n\nCampaigner Colleagues\n\nCampaigners are people-people, and as far as the workplace is concerned, this quality shows through best among colleagues. More than just coworkers, Campaigners view their colleagues as friends, people who they take a genuine interest in, providing support and cheer when they\u2019re down or stressed. People with the Campaigner personality type are warm and optimistic, always searching for and usually finding win-win situations for everyone.\n\nBrainstorms among equals are Campaigners\u2019 forte, and they listen to different viewpoints and suggestions not just with tolerance, but genuine excitement. Their ability to relax and have fun will always make them popular around the water cooler, but what sets Campaigners apart is that they can transition that popularity into natural leadership, instinctively picking up on colleagues\u2019 motivations and pulling their teams together, pushing them forward towards whatever truth they\u2019ve been tasked to find.\n\nCampaigner Managers\n\nCampaigners are not great fans of heavy hierarchy and bureaucracy, and this is most evident when they take on the role of manager. As managers, Campaigner personalities behave much like they do as colleagues \u2013 they establish real friendships, and use their broad popularity to inspire and motivate, taking on the role of leader, working alongside their subordinates, rather than shouting from behind their desks. Campaigners will tend to believe in the concept of intrinsic motivation, the idea that things are worth doing for their own sake, not because of some convoluted system of punishments and rewards.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone buys into this philosophy \u2013 challenges arise when faced with subordinates who actually prefer to be closely directed, with clearly defined objectives and timetables, people who are just doing their jobs. More challenging still are those rare moments when a reprimand is simply necessary \u2013 while Campaigners prefer to meet dissent with an open ear, and to use their excellent capacity for sensing mood and morale to preempt such an act to begin with, sometimes the carrot and the stick are necessary, and using them is the biggest challenge for the Campaigner personality type. But Campaigners\u2019 capacity for adjusting their communication to most any style will always shine through, helping to smooth things over and adapt to the needs of their team.\n\n07"

                "content": "Introduction\n\nWHO IS A LOGISTICIAN (ISTJ)?\n\nA Logistician (ISTJ) is someone with the Introverted, Observant, Thinking, and Judging personality traits. These people tend to be reserved yet willful, with a rational outlook on life. They compose their actions carefully and carry them out with methodical purpose.\n\nMy observation is that whenever one person is found adequate to the discharge of a duty... it is worse executed by two persons, and scarcely done at all if three or more are employed therein.\n\nGEORGE WASHINGTON\n\nThe Logistician personality type is thought to be the most abundant, making up around 13% of the population. Their defining characteristics of integrity, practical logic and tireless dedication to duty make Logisticians a vital core to many families, as well as organizations that uphold traditions, rules and standards, such as law offices, regulatory bodies and military. People with the Logistician personality type enjoy taking responsibility for their actions, and take pride in the work they do \u2013 when working towards a goal, Logisticians hold back none of their time and energy completing each relevant task with accuracy and patience.\n\nLogisticians don\u2019t make many assumptions, preferring instead to analyze their surroundings, check their facts and arrive at practical courses of action. Logistician personalities are no-nonsense, and when they\u2019ve made a decision, they will relay the facts necessary to achieve their goal, expecting others to grasp the situation immediately and take action. Logisticians have little tolerance for indecisiveness, but lose patience even more quickly if their chosen course is challenged with impractical theories, especially if they ignore key details \u2013 if challenges becomes time-consuming debates, Logisticians can become noticeably angry as deadlines tick nearer.\n\nAssociate With Those of Good Quality if You Esteem Your Reputation...\n\nWhen Logisticians say they are going to get something done, they do it, meeting their obligations no matter the personal cost, and they are baffled by people who don\u2019t hold their own word in the same respect. Combining laziness and dishonesty is the quickest way to get on Logisticians\u2019 bad side. Consequently, people with the Logistician personality type often prefer to work alone, or at least have their authority clearly established by hierarchy, where they can set and achieve their goals without debate or worry over other\u2019s reliability.\n\nLogisticians have sharp, fact-based minds, and prefer autonomy and self-sufficiency to reliance on someone or something. Dependency on others is often seen by Logisticians as a weakness, and their passion for duty, dependability and impeccable personal integrity forbid falling into such a trap.\n\nThis sense of personal integrity is core to Logisticians, and goes beyond their own minds \u2013 Logistician personalities adhere to established rules and guidelines regardless of cost, reporting their own mistakes and telling the truth even when the consequences for doing so could be disastrous. To Logisticians, honesty is far more important than emotional considerations, and their blunt approach leaves others with the false impression that Logisticians are cold, or even robotic. People with this type may struggle to express emotion or affection outwardly, but the suggestion that they don\u2019t feel, or worse have no personality at all, is deeply hurtful.\n\n...For It Is Better to Be Alone Than in Bad Company\n\nLogisticians\u2019 dedication is an excellent quality, allowing them to accomplish much, but it is also a core weakness that less scrupulous individuals take advantage of. Logisticians seek stability and security, considering it their duty to maintain a smooth operation, and they may find that their coworkers and significant others shift their responsibilities onto them, knowing that they will always take up the slack. Logisticians tend to keep their opinions to themselves and let the facts do the talking, but it can be a long time before observable evidence tells the whole story.\n\nLogisticians need to remember to take care of themselves \u2013 their stubborn dedication to stability and efficiency can compromise those goals in the long term as others lean ever-harder on them, creating an emotional strain that can go unexpressed for years, only finally coming out after it\u2019s too late to fix. If they can find coworkers and spouses who genuinely appreciate and complement their qualities, who enjoy the brightness, clarity and dependability that they offer, Logisticians will find that their stabilizing role is a tremendously satisfying one, knowing that they are part of a system that works.\n\n01",

                "content": "Strengths & Weaknesses\nLogistician Strengths\nHonest and Direct \u2013 Integrity is the heart of the Logistician personality type. Emotional manipulation, mind games and reassuring lies all run counter to Logisticians\u2019 preference for managing the reality of the situations they encounter with plain and simple honesty.\nStrong-willed and Dutiful \u2013 Logisticians embody that integrity in their actions too, working hard and staying focused on their goals. Patient and determined, people with the Logistician personality type meet their obligations, period.\nVery Responsible \u2013 Logisticians\u2019 word is a promise, and a promise means everything. Logisticians would rather run themselves into the ground with extra days and lost sleep than fail to deliver the results they said they would. Loyalty is a strong sentiment for Logistician personalities, and they fulfill their duties to the people and organizations they\u2019ve committed themselves to.\nCalm and Practical \u2013 None of their promises would mean much if Logisticians lost their tempers and broke down at every sign of hardship \u2013 they keep their feet on the ground and make clear, rational decisions. Peoples\u2019 preferences are a factor to consider in this process, and Logisticians work to make the best use of individual qualities, but these decisions are made with effectiveness in mind more so than empathy. The same applies to criticisms, for others and themselves.\nCreate and Enforce Order \u2013 The primary goal of any Logistician is to be effective in what they\u2019ve chosen to do, and they believe that this is accomplished best when everyone involved knows exactly what is going on and why. Unclear guidelines and people who break established rules undermine this effort, and are rarely tolerated by Logisticians. Structure and rules foster dependability; chaos creates unforeseen setbacks and missed deadlines.\nJacks-of-all-trades \u2013 Much like Analyst personality types, Logisticians are proud repositories of knowledge, though the emphasis is more on facts and statistics than concepts and underlying principles. This allows Logisticians to apply themselves to a variety of situations, picking up and applying new data and grasping the details of challenging situations as a matter of course.\nLogistician Weaknesses\nStubborn \u2013 The facts are the facts, and Logisticians tend to resist any new idea that isn\u2019t supported by them. This factual decision-making process also makes it difficult for people with the Logistician personality type to accept that they were wrong about something \u2013 but anyone can miss a detail, even them.\nInsensitive \u2013 While not intentionally harsh, Logisticians often hurt more sensitive types\u2019 feelings by the simple mantra that honesty is the best policy. Logistician personalities may take emotions into consideration, but really only so far as to determine the most effective way to say what needs to be said.\nAlways by the Book \u2013 Logisticians believe that things work best with clearly defined rules, but this makes them reluctant to bend those rules or try new things, even when the downside is minimal. Truly unstructured environments leave Logisticians all but paralyzed.\nJudgmental \u2013 Opinions are opinions and facts are facts, and Logisticians are unlikely to respect people who disagree with those facts, or especially those who remain willfully ignorant of them.\nOften Unreasonably Blame Themselves \u2013 All this can combine to make Logisticians believe they are the only ones who can see projects through reliably. As they load themselves with extra work and responsibilities, turning away good intentions and helpful ideas, Logisticians sooner or later hit a tipping point where they simply can\u2019t deliver. Since they\u2019ve heaped the responsibility on themselves, Logisticians then believe the responsibility for failure is theirs alone to bear.\n02"

                "content": "Romantic Relationships\n\nLogisticians are dependable through and through, and this trait is clearly expressed when it comes to their romantic relationships. Often representing the epitome of family values, people with the Logistician personality type are comfortable with, and often even encourage traditional household and gender roles, and look to a family structure guided by clear expectations and honesty. While their reserved nature often makes dating Logisticians challenging, they are truly dedicated partners, willing to devote tremendous thought and energy to ensure stable and mutually satisfying relationships.\n\nHappiness and Moral Duty Are Inseparably Connected\n\nBlind dates and random hookups are not Logisticians\u2019 preferred methods for finding potential partners. The risk and unpredictability of these situations has Logisticians\u2019 alarm bells ringing, and being dragged out for a night of dancing at the club just isn\u2019t going to happen. Logistician personalities much prefer more responsible, conservative methods of dating, such as dinner with an interested coworker or, in their more adventurous moods, a setup organized through a mutual friend.\n\nLogisticians approach relationships, as with most things, from a rational perspective, looking for compatibility and the mutual satisfaction of daily and long-term needs. This isn\u2019t a process that Logisticians take lightly, and once commitments are established, they stick to their promises to the very end. Logisticians establish foundations, fulfill their responsibilities, and keep their relationships functional and stable.\n\nAs their relationships transitions into the long-term, Logisticians gladly see to the necessary daily tasks around the house, applying the same sense of duty to their home life that they do in the workplace.\n\nWhile this may not translate into particularly exotic intimate lives, Logisticians are dependable lovers who want very much for their partners to remain satisfied. It takes patience on the part of more adventurous partners, but if different activities can be demonstrated as equally or more enjoyable than those already within Logisticians\u2019 comfort zones, they are perfectly capable of trying something new.\n\nHowever, emotional satisfaction can be another matter. While Logisticians are able to provide surprisingly good emotional support, this only happens when they realize that it\u2019s necessary, and there\u2019s the rub. Logisticians are not naturally receptive to others\u2019 emotions, not unless they are stated clearly, and a partner usually only says \u201cI\u2019m angry\u201d when it\u2019s too late to address the initial grievance.\n\nLet Your Heart Feel Their Afflictions, and Give Proportionally\n\nPeople with the Logistician personality type can get so caught up in the belief in their correctness, in \u201cwinning\u201d arguments they thought were about facts, that they don\u2019t realize their partner may have viewed things from a perspective of consideration and sensitivity. Especially with more sensitive partners, this can be a huge challenge for the relationship. Ultimately though, Logisticians\u2019 senses of responsibility and dedication set the tone, and they spare no effort in noting to this distinction moving forward, the consequences having been demonstrated as real.\n\nWhile Logisticians\u2019 staid approach may seem boring to some, there is an undeniable attractiveness to it, though felt perhaps more by respect and admiration than emotional passion. Logisticians\u2019 shells hide a strong and quiet determination and reliability, rare among other personality types, which can benefit even the flightiest personalities, allowing them to stay connected to the real world while still exploring new territory. Partners who share the Observant (S) trait are the best fit for Logistician personalities, with one or two opposing traits to create balance and to expand Logisticians\u2019 sometimes overly isolated world, such as partners with Extraverted (E) or Prospecting (P) traits.\n\n03"

What Logistician friends are is loyal, trustworthy, honorable and dependable. Others may come and go with the ups and downs of life, but Logisticians stay by their friends\u2019 sides no matter what, with a deepness of commitment that other types may not even believe is possible.\n\nTrue Friendship Is a Plant of Slow Growth\n\nLogisticians are a very methodical personality type, and this loyalty isn\u2019t given away lightly. Often slow to make friends, Logisticians usually end up with a smaller circle, but they consider that circle to represent a promise to be there for the people they care about, and Logisticians\u2019 promises are not easily broken.\n\nExpressing emotional affection isn\u2019t one of Logisticians\u2019 stronger skills, but they nevertheless find ways to show it. As Socrates said, \u201cTo be is to do\u201d, and Logisticians\u2019 follow-through, their willingness to take action as a show of support, stands in for their words.\n\nThese actions convey a sensitivity that many fail to see, but it is a quality that Logisticians\u2019 friends come to admire and depend on in the long years of their friendships.\n\nBut all of this sounds terribly serious, and indeed it only shows the one side of Logisticians and their approach to their friendships. The other side knows how to stop being quite so staid, and especially in the company of joyful and talkative Extraverts (E), Logisticians enjoy relaxing and having fun with a good discussion about work, life, and current events.\n\nPeople with the Logistician personality type don\u2019t like conflict, and this applies to how they select their friends as well. Seeking out friends with similar principles and opinions, Logisticians most often befriend other Sentinels personalities, who are likely to share their perspective and world vision. While they are unlikely to become friends with substantially different types \u2013 it simply takes too much energy to bridge the communication gap \u2013 Logistician personalities still recognize and appreciate others\u2019 strengths and qualities.\n\nKnowledge Is the Surest Basis of Happiness\n\nIn fact, as if to prove the point, Logisticians almost always have at least one Intuitive (N) friend in their inner circle, despite the disconnect the two perspectives bring. These are very much relationships built not on mutual understanding, but out of respect for their mutual differences. Logisticians marvel at Intuitives\u2019 breadth of thought, being very much in tune with their own intelligence, while Intuitives admire Logisticians\u2019 realism and dependability, something they are often hard-pressed to find in themselves. Knowledge, as always, is the great equalizer.\n\n04"

                "content": "Parenthood\n\nAs parents, people with the Logistician personality type are often the most comfortable. Their sense of responsibility and honor blends well with a tradition that has been in place since time immemorial: to raise one\u2019s children to be respected, contributing members of home and society. As with most commitments, Logisticians do not take their roles as parents lightly, and will make it their work to ensure that this tradition is upheld to the highest standard.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t always come easily for their children though, as Logisticians tend to be strict, with high standards and expectations. Logistician personalities establish stable, clearly structured environments for their children, always with an eye on helping them to develop a sense of place in society, and to fulfill useful roles.\n\nA clear sense of hierarchy is a part of developing this identity, and Logisticians work just as much to ensure an appropriate respect for authority as they do with family and societal structure.\n\nAll this loyalty, devotion and structure are of little use though when Logisticians\u2019 children need the warmth of emotional support. While Logisticians can be sensitive towards those they care about in their own way, it\u2019s hard for younger children and especially adolescents to recognize this tough love for the love that it is. Often Logisticians need to rely on a more sensitive partner to fill this role and mediate between rational purpose and the more ethereal sense of emotional well-being.\n\nSuccess Is Owed to Our Parents\u2019 Moral and Intellectual Teachings\n\nPeople with the Logistician personality type are strongly principled, valuing patience and hard work, qualities children often struggle with. Nevertheless, Logisticians\u2019 children are expected to meet these standards and share these values, for their own good. This approach often bears its fruit in the long run, but Logisticians must keep in mind that their approach creates natural barriers and distance that often leave their children wondering if they\u2019re on the same team.\n\nTaken too far, or with mutual stubbornness, this may even set in as a permanent state in the relationship, something both Logistician parents and their children ultimately regret. It is best for Logisticians to embrace and hold to their own values, but to also recognize that each person has their own goals, and to meet their children halfway in attaining theirs. Combining their natural devotion and purpose with this flexibility in support of their children\u2019s own vision leads to a sense of mutual respect and accomplishment that any Logistician parent would be proud of.\n\n05"

                "content": "Career Paths\n\nWhile many personality types may be comfortable with flexible work as consultants and sole proprietors, Logisticians are much more focused on building long-term, stable careers. That\u2019s not to say that Logisticians can\u2019t do that sort of work \u2013 many find themselves thinking about what\u2019s on the other side of those cubical walls \u2013 but what they crave is dependability, and that is reflected in their choice of work perhaps more so than in any other part of their lives.\n\nHave No Other View Than to Promote the Public Good\n\nThe facts support this, as the most common careers among people with the Logistician personality type revolve around institutions of respected tradition, authority, security, and established consistency. Careers as military officers, lawyers, judges, police officers and detectives are all very popular among Logisticians. This makes sense, as they not only offer the stability that Logisticians seek, but are in line with their principles and conservatism, establishing clear societal roles.\n\nLogisticians of course aren\u2019t limited to these organizations \u2013 there are many other roles that utilize their reliability, objectivity and sharp eyes. When facts and logic are out of place, Logistician personalities swoop in as the accountants, auditors, data analysts, financial managers, business administrators and even doctors that identify, report and correct the issues at hand.\n\nMost of these careers have Logisticians working alone, which is usually their preference, but when teams are necessary, they are best defined by clearly outlined roles, responsibilities and work environments.\n\nNothing is quite so challenging for Logisticians as ongoing debates about who is responsible for what, resulting in work that\u2019s shoddily assembled \u2013 or worse, incomplete.\n\nLogisticians have strong opinions about how things should be done, and if things are shuffled too often, people with this personality type can become surprisingly vocal about their opposition. It\u2019s important for Logisticians to remember that even the most traditional and stable career paths can and need to change as time goes by. It is much better to accept this with grace than to develop reputations of being enemies of new ideas.\n\nBusiness Discourse Should Be Short and Comprehensive\n\nLogisticians may also struggle with the increasingly open and social requirements of modern work life. Being somewhat bad at sensing others feelings, Logisticians\u2019 \u201cjust the facts\u201d attitude can be downright alienating when it comes to more sensitive personality types. This applies not just to coworkers but to customers as well \u2013 service positions like retail sales and waiting tables, as well as more emotionally demanding careers such as psychiatry are, generally speaking, a terrible fit.\n\nThe ideal career paths feature a trend: they place facts above feelings and allow Logisticians to uphold the hard standards that are the backbone of society. Rules are the basis for everything people take for granted about modern life, from the social contract that smooths relationships, to the laws that protect peoples\u2019 most basic safety, to the constitutions and treaties that govern nations. People with the Logistician personality type take on roles as the defenders of these ideas, in big ways and small, and are rightfully proud of it.\n\n06"

                "content": "Workplace Habits\n\nWhen it comes to the workplace, Logisticians are almost a stereotype for the classic hard-working, dutiful employee. In all positions, the Logistician personality type seeks structure, clearly defined rules, and respect for authority and hierarchy. Responsibilities aren\u2019t burdens to Logisticians, they are the trust that has been placed in them, an opportunity to prove once again that they are the right person for the job.\n\nOn the other hand, the change that comes with assuming those new responsibilities, or in losing old ones, is often a significant struggle for Logisticians. This presents itself differently in different positions of authority, but it is one of Logisticians\u2019 most significant challenges to overcome. The usual insensitivity common to all Thinking (T) types is also a running theme here, something many people with the Logistician personality type choose to focus on in their personal and professional development.\n\nLogistician Subordinates\n\nLogisticians crave responsibility, which makes them the go-to subordinates for odds and ends and unpopular projects. Often seen as jacks of all trades, Logistician personalities can competently tackle any project that comes with a manual. On the other hand, this makes them reluctant to give up responsibilities even when they are overburdened, or when there are better people for the job. The seriousness in Logisticians\u2019 approach to their work makes them surprisingly sensitive to criticism, leading to a sometimes vexing level of inflexibility.\n\nTheir stubbornness aside, or perhaps because of it, Logisticians are quite possibly one of the most productive subordinates \u2013 they respect authority and hierarchy, and have no problem following orders and instructions. Punctuality is unlikely to ever be an issue, either in terms of showing up to work on time, or in terms of meeting project deadlines. While Logisticians may need clearly set steps and well-defined responsibilities, they are exceptionally loyal, dedicated, meticulous and patient in completing their work.\n\nLogistician Colleagues\n\nAmong colleagues, no one can be trusted more to ensure that projects are finished on time and by the book than Logisticians. Quiet and methodical, people with the Logistician personality type keep cool when the going gets tough, but expect their colleagues to share their approach. Significantly different types, especially more emotional ones, baffle Logisticians with their need for emotional support and openness, or capacity for dropping something, half finished. To Logisticians, either something\u2019s been done right or it\u2019s been done wrong, and sugarcoating it or walking away isn\u2019t going to fix it.\n\nLogisticians value peace and security in the workplace, and the easiest way for this to happen is for them to simply work alone. Innovations, brainstorming, theories and new ideas all disrupt this comfortable state, and it takes a great deal of respect on Logisticians\u2019 part to acknowledge their validity. Once the details have been laid out and a plan of implementation established though, Logisticians are an indispensable part of the team in putting these ideas into practice.\n\nLogistician Managers\n\nLogisticians love responsibility and the power resulting from it. Pressing themselves hard to meet their obligations, Logisticians regularly go above and beyond their duties, and expect their subordinates to act with the same level of dedication. At the same time, Logisticians\u2019 preference for doing things by the book, adherence to hierarchy, and general aversion to innovation makes their subordinates ride a very thin line when they do \u2013 stepping out of bounds must be backed up with just the facts, and results.\n\nIt is said that it is better to do first and ask permission later \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to say whether this applies to Logisticians, as they are very intolerant of their subordinates\u2019 failures to meet their obligations, and one of those obligations is to stick to the plan. Believing that truth, at least as far as they see it, is more important than sensitivity, Logistician personalities are capable of laying down hard criticism, and their willingness to make tough decisions can make perceived insubordination the final trespass.\n\n07"

These people tend to be warm and unassuming in their own steady way. They\u2019re efficient and responsible, giving careful attention to practical details in their daily lives.\n\nLove only grows by sharing. You can only have more for yourself by giving it away to others.\n\nBRIAN TRACY\n\nThe Defender personality type is quite unique, as many of their qualities defy the definition of their individual traits. Though sensitive, Defenders have excellent analytical abilities; though reserved, they have well-developed people skills and robust social relationships; and though they are generally a conservative type, Defenders are often receptive to change and new ideas. As with so many things, people with the Defender personality type are more than the sum of their parts, and it is the way they use these strengths that defines who they are.\n\nDefenders are true altruists, meeting kindness with kindness-in-excess and engaging the work and people they believe in with enthusiasm and generosity.\n\nThere\u2019s hardly a better type to make up such a large proportion of the population, nearly 13%. Combining the best of tradition and the desire to do good, Defenders are found in lines of work with a sense of history behind them, such as medicine, academics and charitable social work.\n\nDefender personalities (especially Turbulent ones) are often meticulous to the point of perfectionism, and though they procrastinate, they can always be relied on to get the job done on time. Defenders take their responsibilities personally, consistently going above and beyond, doing everything they can to exceed expectations and delight others, at work and at home.\n\nWe Must Be Seen to Be Believed\n\nThe challenge for Defenders is ensuring that what they do is noticed. They have a tendency to underplay their accomplishments, and while their kindness is often respected, more cynical and selfish people are likely to take advantage of Defenders\u2019 dedication and humbleness by pushing work onto them and then taking the credit. Defenders need to know when to say no and stand up for themselves if they are to maintain their confidence and enthusiasm.\n\nNaturally social, an odd quality for Introverts, Defenders utilize excellent memories not to retain data and trivia, but to remember people, and details about their lives. When it comes to gift-giving, Defenders have no equal, using their imagination and natural sensitivity to express their generosity in ways that touch the hearts of their recipients. While this is certainly true of their coworkers, whom people with the Defender personality type often consider their personal friends, it is in family that their expressions of affection fully bloom.\n\nIf I Can Protect You, I Will\n\nDefender personalities are a wonderful group, rarely sitting idle while a worthy cause remains unfinished. Defenders\u2019 ability to connect with others on an intimate level is unrivaled among Introverts, and the joy they experience in using those connections to maintain a supportive, happy family is a gift for everyone involved. They may never be truly comfortable in the spotlight, and may feel guilty taking due credit for team efforts, but if they can ensure that their efforts are recognized, Defenders are likely to feel a level of satisfaction in what they do that many other personality types can only dream of.\n\n01",

People with this personality type strive for win-win situations, choosing empathy over judgment whenever possible.\nReliable and Patient \u2013 Rather than offering sporadic, excited rushes that leave things half finished, Defenders are meticulous and careful, taking a steady approach and bending with the needs of the situation just enough to accomplish their end goals. Defenders not only ensure that things are done to the highest standard, but often go well beyond what is required.\nImaginative and Observant \u2013 Defenders are very imaginative, and use this quality as an accessory to empathy, observing others\u2019 emotional states and seeing things from their perspective. With their feet firmly planted on the ground, it is a very practical imagination, though they do find things quite fascinating and inspiring.\nEnthusiastic \u2013 When the goal is right, Defenders take all this support, reliability and imagination and apply it to something they believe will make a difference in people\u2019s lives \u2013 whether fighting poverty with a global initiative or simply making a customer\u2019s day.\nLoyal and Hard-Working \u2013 Given a little time, this enthusiasm grows into loyalty \u2013 Defender personalities often form an emotional attachment to the ideas and organizations they\u2019ve dedicated themselves to. Anything short of meeting their obligations with good, hard work fails their own expectations.\nGood Practical Skills \u2013 The best part is, Defenders have the practical sense to actually do something with all this altruism. If mundane, routine tasks are what need to be done, Defenders can see the beauty and harmony that they create, because they know that it helps them to care for their friends, family, and anyone else who needs it.\nDefender Weaknesses\nHumble and Shy \u2013 The meek shall inherit the earth, but it\u2019s a long road if they receive no recognition at all. This is possibly Defenders\u2019 biggest challenge, as they are so concerned with others\u2019 feelings that they refuse to make their thoughts known, or to take any duly earned credit for their contributions. Defenders\u2019 standards for themselves are also so high that, knowing they could have done some minor aspect of a task better, they often downplay their successes entirely.\nTake Things Too Personally \u2013 Defenders have trouble separating personal and impersonal situations \u2013 any situation is still an interaction between two people, after all \u2013 and any negativity from conflict or criticism can carry over from their professional to their personal lives, and back again.\nRepress Their Feelings \u2013 People with the Defender personality type are private and very sensitive, internalizing their feelings a great deal. Much in the way that Defenders protect others\u2019 feelings, they must protect their own, and this lack of healthy emotional expression can lead to a lot of stress and frustration.\nOverload Themselves \u2013 Their strong senses of duty and perfectionism combine with this aversion to emotional conflict to create a situation where it is far too easy for Defenders to overload themselves \u2013 or to be overloaded by others \u2013 as they struggle silently to meet everyone\u2019s expectations, especially their own.\nReluctant to Change \u2013 These challenges can be particularly hard to address since Defender personalities value traditions and history highly in their decisions. A situation sometimes needs to reach a breaking point before Defenders are persuaded by circumstance, or the strong personality of a loved one, to alter course.\nToo Altruistic \u2013 This is all compounded and reinforced by Defenders\u2019 otherwise wonderful quality of altruism. Being such warm, good-natured people, Defenders are willing to let things slide, to believe that things will get better soon, to not burden others by accepting their offers of help, while their troubles mount unassisted.\n02"

Home is where the heart is for people with the Defender personality type, and in no other area of their lives do they strive with such dedication to create the harmony and beauty they wish to see in the world.\n\nThe trouble is, these are the benefits of an established long-term relationship, and Defenders\u2019 unbearable shyness means it can take a long time to reach this point. Defenders are most attractive when they are simply being themselves in a comfortable environment such as work, where their natural flow shows this kindness and dedication. Relationships built on established familiarity are a warm prospect for Defenders \u2013 they take dating seriously and only enter into relationships that have a real chance of lasting a lifetime.\n\nOur Upward Course Is Due to Our Soundness of Heart\n\nDefenders\u2019 shyness and sensitivity shield what are, beneath the surface, incredibly strong feelings. While not always obvious to others, this river of emotion can\u2019t be taken lightly or for granted \u2013 Defender personalities can value the idea of committed romance almost as highly as some regard religious beliefs. Hard as it may be, if either dating partner doubts their feelings, they must part ways before real emotional damage is done.\n\nAs their relationships do progress, Defenders often continue to struggle with emotional expression, but they have the opportunity to let physical affection stand in for their loving words. People with this personality type take no greater joy than in pleasing others, often even considering this a personal duty, and this applies to intimacy as well. While dutiful sex may not sound especially attractive in those specific terms, intimacy is tremendously important to Defenders, and they spare no effort in this department.\n\nNor is the pleasure they take in ensuring their partners\u2019 happiness limited to the bedroom \u2013 Defenders spend an enormous amount of time and energy finding ways to keep their relationship satisfying for their partners. All they ask in return is commitment, love and, perhaps most of all, appreciation.\n\nLike All the Best Families, We Have Our Disagreements...\n\nHowever, not everyone is prepared to pay even that small price for the benefit of Defenders\u2019 kindness. If their partners aren\u2019t willing or able to express this thanks, or worse still are openly critical of their Defender partners, they will find that, given time and pressure, all of those repressed emotions can burst forth in massive verbal attacks that all the future regret in the world won\u2019t blunt.\n\nThese outbursts are something to watch out for, but the more pervasive issue in Defenders\u2019 relationships is that it can be too easy for their altruism and kindness to be taken advantage of, maybe even without their partners realizing it, while leaving Defenders\u2019 own needs and dreams unfulfilled. This is something that Defenders\u2019 partners, and Defender personalities themselves, must look after if they want the sort of long, fulfilling relationships they dream about. Expressing appreciation is often more than just the right words, it is reciprocation.\n\nIf these couples can manage this balance of mutual appreciation and goal-setting, they will come to find that the best Defender qualities emerge later in the relationship, as they work towards establishing families and homes together.\n\nWhile perfectly capable in the workplace and among friends, Defenders\u2019 true passions lie in taking care of their families, from playing with their children to the mundane needs of the household, efforts Defenders are only too happy to contribute.\n\nDefenders are trustworthy, loyal, loving and faithful and nothing brings them more joy than the commitment of an appreciative and thriving relationship. The best matches are those who share these sensibilities, namely those who share the Observant (S) trait, with one or two opposing traits to ensure that both partners have room to grow, develop and help each other along, \u2019til the end of their days.\n\n03"

The challenge is to be considered a friend back \u2013 people with the Defender personality type are shy and a little protective of themselves, but they also need to be able to connect on a deeper emotional level. It makes sense then that most of Defenders\u2019 friends are made not by random encounters on a wild night out, but through comfortable and consistent contact, as in class or in the workplace where they have the time to get to know each other little by little.\n\nA lot of what establishes and deepens Defenders\u2019 friendships is the mutual support, advice and reassurance that the friends give each other.\n\nDefenders need a lot of positive feedback, and admitting this need certainly shows vulnerability, but if that vulnerability is well handled, it creates the deep bonds that Defender personalities look for. If badly handled or not reciprocated, it\u2019s hard to see the burgeoning friendship surviving without quite a bit of extra effort.\n\nYet, as their friendships develop, Defenders\u2019 sense of loyalty may push them to lean ever more on themselves to meet their friends\u2019 needs, to the point of neglecting their own. Defenders show this in a few ways, from going clearly out of their ways to stick to even trivial commitments, to simply not wanting to disagree or say no for fear of causing turbulence. More cynical types would call this na\u00efve, and may even take advantage of Defenders\u2019 altruism \u2013 but these are hardly the type of people who could be called \u201cfriends\u201d, and they have no business being discussed here.\n\nTo What Greater Inspiration and Counsel Can We Turn?\n\nThe real friends, those close inner circles, are the ones Defenders truly cherish for their quality of character and quality of discussion. Defenders aren\u2019t particularly picky about what personality types they make friends with, at least not initially, but because they prefer so strongly to avoid conflict and miscommunication, most of their friends are likely to end up being fairly similar personalities.\n\n04"

Many people with this personality type feel like parenting is the task they were born for, taking no small pleasure in the sense of personal importance and responsibility they feel in ensuring that their children grow up to be healthy, confident and successful. At the same time, Defenders are anything but arrogant, and will hardly take their natural skill in this department for granted.\n\nFrom the start, Defenders\u2019 altruism is apparent in their approach towards their children, ensuring that they have a safe, stable environment filled with love, care and support. In their children\u2019s younger years, Defenders\u2019 patience comes in very handy as well, as their children learn to become more independent and self-deterministic, testing any limit they can find.\n\nSeeing the World in Its True Light\nIt is this transition though, from the utter dependence of infants, to the insatiable exploration of toddlers and young children, to the rejection of authority of adolescents that Defenders are taken by surprise.\n\nVery traditional personality types, Defenders accept historic standards, with clearly defined roles as parents and children. They view their role, and often rightly so, as the imparter of their own wisdom and values, ensuring that their children understand the importance of dedication and responsibility.\n\nWhat many Defender parents may not realize is that more independent children often reject the seemingly overbearing love and support that make Defender personalities such wonderful parental figures. They wish to determine their own values and make their own choices, and Defenders\u2019 good intentions can make them feel like every aspect of their lives is sealed off and controlled. All the while, Defender parents must ensure that more dependent children, who are willing to lean on all of this care and support rather than rebel against it, do not take these admirable qualities for granted, neglecting their own independence entirely.\n\nDo Right, Even if We Suffer in so Doing\n\nDefenders are uncomfortable when their children don\u2019t behave as expected, and oftentimes more insightful children see, and sometimes exploit, this potential weakness with tantrums and mind games. It takes a strong will for Defenders to put their foot down and teach clear and reasonable boundaries and values, while at the same time affording their children the freedom to grow and develop on their own.\n\nParenting is not easy for any personality type, not if they\u2019re doing it right, but Defenders do have the advantage of not just being caring, but being thoughtful and responsible in how they administer that care. Often seen as ideal parents, people with the Defender personality type are able to be there for their children, but to also know that there\u2019s more to people than meets the eye, and to respect those differences \u2013 if not always to understand them.\n\n05"

                "content": "Career Paths\n\nIn many ways, Defenders are the backbone of the modern workforce. Altruistic and well-rounded, no other personality type is so well-suited to be of service of others. It is no surprise that many Defenders are not just good at supporting their coworkers and customers in human resources and support positions, they genuinely enjoy it, as it gives them the chance to calm frustrations, see things through to a practical solution, and to be thanked, appreciated, at the close of each ordeal.\n\nBe Humble and Earnest\n\nDefenders are skilled at remembering things about others which makes them not only valuable assistants, but well-liked colleagues. People with the Defender personality type can always be counted on to remember a birthday, a graduation, or simply a frequent customers\u2019 name, and that can make all the difference. Add to these amiable qualities Defenders\u2019 meticulousness, hard work and dedication, and it\u2019s no surprise that their careers often progress smoothly, with few of the ups and downs that accompany more high-flying types.\n\nHowever, Defenders are unlikely to actively seek out managerial positions, and are still more unlikely to brag about their accomplishments. Defender personalities prefer to be rewarded by seeing first-hand the positive impact of their efforts, and will remain enthusiastic simply knowing that what they do is genuinely appreciated by the people they care for. This makes them natural counselors, technical support, and interior designers, where they are able to help others one-on-one without having to worry about corporate politics.\n\nWhether they seek promotion or not it happens often enough, as Defenders\u2019 ability to implement ideas and \u201ccreate order from chaos\u201d is bound to make an impression.\n\nRespecting tradition and security, Defenders have no problem with the idea of moving along in a structured hierarchy, and while they may not always seek out these managerial positions, they fill them well. Defenders are well-tuned to others\u2019 emotions and have a strong sense of practicality, extending their own ability to get things done to their teams.\n\nWhere Defenders struggle is in generating new ideas and in grasping abstract concepts \u2013 fields like academic research and corporate strategy are too intangible and too impersonal to utilize Defenders\u2019 strengths. Similar challenges arise in more typical careers when changes are forced through by Defenders\u2019 employers \u2013 advance warning and a proper explanation can help to smooth the shock, but if the changes cut back on things like the quality of customer service, it can feel like a betrayal in the face of their loyalty and dedication.\n\nLive Pleasantly and Do Good\n\nStrong, well-developed institutions alongside like-minded friends are attractive workplaces for people with the Defender personality type, and careers as nurses, elementary school teachers and social and religious workers are attractive options. Sometimes the desire to help others is enough in itself \u2013 it\u2019s not uncommon to find Defenders volunteering and helping the community at shelters, food banks and their children\u2019s schools. Defenders are warm, service-oriented people, and hardly anyone is more welcome in these (and many, many other) roles.\n\n06"

Whether helping customers directly, helping coworkers get projects finished on time or helping teams keep organized and productive, people with the Defender personality type can always be relied on for their kindness and ability to listen to concerns, and to find ways to resolve them. Win-win situations are Defenders\u2019 bread and butter, and no one takes quite the same pleasure in finding satisfying resolutions to day-to-day challenges.\n\nDefender Subordinates\n\nAs subordinates, Defenders exemplify the strength of humble dedication. Relied on and respected for their patience and commitment, Defender personalities really only seek one reward for their work: the satisfaction of knowing that whoever they helped feels heartfelt thanks. On the other hand, this humbleness can hold them back \u2013 Defenders are quite unwilling to advertise their achievements, often for fear of creating unnecessary friction, which makes it too easy for them to be overlooked when opportunities come along.\n\nDefenders are people of incredible loyalty, often trying to follow favored managers to new positions and locations. This contrasts with their usual feelings on change which, if it compromises their principles (as cutbacks to customer care might), is met with stress and unhappiness. Though perfectly capable of accepting change, Defenders must feel that it\u2019s for the right reasons. If a policy change results in disappointed customers, Defenders take it very personally.\n\nDefender Colleagues\n\nAmong their colleagues, people with this personality type seek a frictionless environment, a spirit of friends helping friends to get the job done. Close-knit and supportive teams are what Defenders enjoy most, allowing them to express their altruistic spirit among people who rely on their dedication and warmth. Defenders are natural networkers, but they use this skill to keep things running smoothly, not as a tool for professional advancement.\n\nThese qualities can be drawbacks though, as Defenders\u2019 aversion to conflict and desire to help can be abused by less scrupulous colleagues. Instead of only asking help when they need it, some may ask for help when they just don\u2019t feel like working hard, knowing that their Defender colleagues have a hard time saying no. The result is that Defenders can become overburdened and stressed, and it takes a few good workplace friends to put pressure on these less savory characters in order to maintain balance.\n\nDefender Managers\n\nWhile management isn\u2019t necessarily at the top of Defenders\u2019 list of goals, it is a natural progression as their hard work and good people skills are recognized over the years. Oftentimes they don\u2019t actually enjoy managing others, but this can be one of their greatest strengths \u2013 as managers, Defenders are warm, approachable and great listeners. Having no real desire to issue authoritarian dictates from some high tower, Defender personalities prefer to work alongside their subordinates, organizing people and minimizing conflict.\n\nThis helps them to create personal relationships with their subordinates, to be friends in the workplace who simply have different sets of responsibilities. While they may be slow to accept some changes, they are great at helping their teams put them into practice once they\u2019ve been agreed on. Defenders may be too sensitive to be fully executive material, but they make exemplary floor and office managers who know what it takes to satisfy their customers.\n\n07"

They possess great fortitude, emphatically following their own sensible judgment. They often serve as a stabilizing force among others, able to offer solid direction amid adversity.\n\nGood order is the foundation of all things.\n\nEDMUND BURKE\n\nExecutives are representatives of tradition and order, utilizing their understanding of what is right, wrong and socially acceptable to bring families and communities together. Embracing the values of honesty, dedication and dignity, people with the Executive personality type are valued for their clear advice and guidance, and they happily lead the way on difficult paths. Taking pride in bringing people together, Executives often take on roles as community organizers, working hard to bring everyone together in celebration of cherished local events, or in defense of the traditional values that hold families and communities together.\n\nAnyone Worth Their Salt Sticks Up for What They Believe Is Right...\n\nDemand for such leadership is high in democratic societies, and forming no less than 11% of the population, it\u2019s no wonder that many of America\u2019s presidents have been Executives. Strong believers in the rule of law and authority that must be earned, Executive personalities lead by example, demonstrating dedication and purposeful honesty, and an utter rejection of laziness and cheating, especially in work. If anyone declares hard, manual work to be an excellent way to build character, it is Executives.\n\nExecutives are aware of their surroundings and live in a world of clear, verifiable facts \u2013 the surety of their knowledge means that even against heavy resistance, they stick to their principles and push an unclouded vision of what is and is not acceptable. Their opinions aren\u2019t just empty talk either, as Executives are more than willing to dive into the most challenging projects, improving action plans and sorting details along the way, making even the most complicated tasks seem easy and approachable.\n\nHowever, Executives don\u2019t work alone, and they expect their reliability and work ethic to be reciprocated \u2013 people with this personality type meet their promises, and if partners or subordinates jeopardize them through incompetence or laziness, or worse still, dishonesty, they do not hesitate to show their wrath. This can earn them a reputation for inflexibility, a trait shared by all Sentinel personalities, but it\u2019s not because Executives are arbitrarily stubborn, but because they truly believe that these values are what make society work.\n\n...But Still Better Are Those Who Acknowledge When They Are in Error\nExecutives are classic images of the model citizen: they help their neighbors, uphold the law, and try to make sure that everyone participates in the communities and organizations they hold so dear.\n\nThe main challenge for Executives is to recognize that not everyone follows the same path or contributes in the same way. A true leader recognizes the strength of the individual, as well as that of the group, and helps bring those individuals\u2019 ideas to the table. That way, Executives really do have all the facts, and are able to lead the charge in directions that work for everyone.\n\n01",

Tasks aren\u2019t simply abandoned because they\u2019ve become difficult or boring \u2013 people with the Executive personality type take them up when they are the right thing to do, and they will be finished so long as they remain the right thing to do.\nStrong-willed \u2013 A strong will makes this dedication possible, and Executives don\u2019t give up their beliefs because of simple opposition. Executives defend their ideas and principles relentlessly, and must be proven clearly and conclusively wrong for their stance to budge.\nDirect and Honest \u2013 Executives trust facts far more than abstract ideas or opinions. Straightforward statements and information are king, and Executive personalities return the honesty (whether it\u2019s wanted or not).\nLoyal, Patient and Reliable \u2013 Executives work to exemplify truthfulness and reliability, considering stability and security very important. When Executives say they\u2019ll do something, they keep their word, making them very responsible members of their families, companies and communities.\nEnjoy Creating Order \u2013 Chaos makes things unpredictable, and unpredictable things can\u2019t be trusted when they are needed most \u2013 with this in mind, Executives strive to create order and security in their environments by establishing rules, structures and clear roles.\nExcellent Organizers \u2013 This commitment to truth and clear standards makes Executives capable and confident leaders. People with this personality type have no problem distributing tasks and responsibilities to others fairly and objectively, making them excellent administrators.\nExecutive Weaknesses\nInflexible and Stubborn \u2013 The problem with being so fixated on what works is that Executives too often dismiss what might work better. Everything is opinion until proven, and Executive personalities are reluctant to trust an opinion long enough for it to have that chance.\nUncomfortable with Unconventional Situations \u2013 Executives are strong adherents to tradition and when suddenly forced to try unvetted solutions, they become uncomfortable and stressed. New ideas suggest that their methods weren\u2019t good enough, and abandoning what has always worked before in favor of something that may yet fail risks their image of reliability.\nJudgmental \u2013 Executives have strong convictions about what is right, wrong, and socially acceptable. Executives\u2019 compulsion to create order often extends to all things and everyone, ignoring the possibility that there are two right ways to get things done. Executives do not hesitate to let these \u201cdeviants\u201d know what they think, considering it their duty to set things right.\nToo Focused on Social Status \u2013 Executives take pride in the respect of their friends, colleagues and community and while difficult to admit, are very concerned with public opinion. Executives (especially Turbulent ones) can get so caught up in meeting others\u2019 expectations that they fail to address their own needs.\nDifficult to Relax \u2013 This need for respect fosters a need to maintain their dignity, which can make it difficult to cut loose and relax for risk of looking the fool, even in good fun.\nDifficulty Expressing Emotion \u2013 This is all evidence of Executives\u2019 greatest weakness: expressing emotions and feeling empathy. People with the Executive personality type get so caught up in the facts and most effective methods that they forget to think of what makes others happy, or of their sensitivity. A detour can be breathtakingly beautiful, a joy for the family, but Executives may only see the consequence of arriving at their destination an hour late, hurting their loved ones by rejecting the notion too harshly.\n02"

Rather, it\u2019s that shifting moods, goals and desires are unlikely to fundamentally alter the basis of Executives\u2019 relationships.\n\nThere are certainly challenges, but Executives take their relationships seriously and are willing to put a tremendous amount of effort into ensuring that they remain strong and committed, and that effort pays off.\n\nThis may all sound a little stale, and indeed Executives are not spontaneous or unpredictable people, but they do very much enjoy taking their partners out and having fun. Social events and activities are Executives\u2019 idea of a good time, and while they may rely on familiar people and places, they do bring lots of energy and enthusiasm, which helps keep things interesting.\n\nExecutives approach intimacy with similarly physical, active intentions, and from fairly traditional ones as well. Wild ideas and poetry are for less mature personalities, or so Executives might say, though they do appreciate recognition and well-placed compliments to maintain high self-esteem. They may look for more stability in their sex lives than most, but Executives never fail to bring their characteristic vigor.\n\nThis hints at a challenge in Executives\u2019 relationships though, and that is emotional intimacy. Touchy-feely moments are few, as are verbal statements of love; this is usually fine, as Executive personalities find other, more tangible ways to express their affection. The problem is in recognizing the validity of those qualities in others, rather than simply dismissing them as pointless or irrational, something that can be extremely hurtful if Executives\u2019 partners are more sensitive.\n\nPay the Price to Secure the Blessing\n\nExecutives address conflict head-on with simple statements of fact \u2013 a very rational approach \u2013 but subtlety and emotional tact are sacrificed in the process. While Executives\u2019 level-headed, calm approach is appreciated by many, for others it is an uncomfortably direct approach. For all their social skills, Executives are especially bad at reading the emotional side of other people, and when it comes to their partners, it\u2019s more important than ever to try to improve.\n\nExecutives are people of strong principles and strong self-confidence. They use these qualities to protect their partners with admirable consistency. But people with the Executive personality type are also stubborn, with a firm belief in their rightness, and they can quickly damage more sensitive partners\u2019 fragile feelings. With this in mind, it is often best for Executives to find fellow Observant (S) partners in order to minimize communication barriers, with one or two opposing traits to balance their forceful character and provide opportunities for growth.\n\n03"

Friendships with the Executive personality type are often defined by their mutual activities and routines, by external factors, more so than the sense of intellectual or mystical compatibility that many Analyst and Diplomat personalities share among themselves. But this in no way diminishes the relationships \u2013 Executives\u2019 friendships of dependability and mutual interest can be powerful connections that endure life\u2019s changes with immutable constancy.\n\nThere Is No Pleasure in Having Nothing to Do...\n\nAmong their established friends, Executives show themselves to be outgoing and enthusiastic, always more than happy to bring others along for some healthy sport and outdoor activity. Executives sometimes get a little overbearing in their push for participation, but it\u2019s just because they want everyone to have a good time. Executives\u2019 friends are never short on invites to social activities and events, from tickets to a local ball game, to a weekend camping trip, to Sunday BBQ.\n\nExecutives seek strong friendships founded on trust and loyalty (though loyalty to family does come first). Active and with quick minds, people with the Executive personality type can\u2019t ever be accused of not doing enough to fend off a little boredom. While Executives may not always be the life of the party, they know how to play their part in making sure their friends have a good time.\n\nThe way Executives establish and maintain their friendships does limit the pool though, as they tend to seek out people who are similar to themselves, who share their respect for traditions and institutions. Executive personalities are naturally stubborn, and it can be hard for them to find enough common ground with people who constantly disagree with their principles and beliefs to really form those ties of friendship.\n\n...The Fun Is in Having Lots to Do and Not Doing It\n\nExecutives\u2019 challenge in friendship isn\u2019t about finding fun things to do or people to do them with, but in finding diversity in their friends and activities. For all their community participation, Executives struggle immensely in even fully listening to differing opinions, let alone befriending people who consistently express alternate viewpoints. Whether about local political issues or the validity of a more emotional, idealistic disposition than they think is reasonable, Executives should make an effort to truly understand these alternate viewpoints.\n\nSimply put, it\u2019s healthy for Executives to have some loyal opposition.\n\nExposing themselves to new ideas among acquaintances who think differently can do no harm \u2013 either people with the Executive personality type discover better ways and a stronger foundation, or they gain all the more confidence in their beliefs for having successfully defended them. Just as Executives may think those loners who spend their lives in their basements playing video games need to get out more, Executives themselves need to make sure they get out of their own bubbles of unchallenged opinions and beliefs.\n\n04"

In many ways, people with the Executive personality type are the classic 50\u2019s era father figure \u2013 very strict, and guardians of family traditions who have no trouble when it comes to enforcing the rules and standards they\u2019ve established. Often seen as model citizens, Executives expect their children to carry that image, continuing the example they\u2019ve set by being polite and respectful \u2013 insubordination is not tolerated.\n\nExecutives have a very responsibility-oriented life-view, a firm belief in the idea that one does what one can do in order to contribute to the family and community.\n\nThis view is of course extended to their children, and as soon as they are able, their children are expected to contribute in their own way, by cleaning their plates and their rooms and going to bed on time \u2013 by maintaining the order of things.\n\nThis inflexibility can become a challenge as their children grow into their more naturally rebellious adolescent years. Executives defend their own, and their relationships with their children are no different, but they expect their children to adhere to the structures they\u2019ve put in place to ensure that protection. Executives enjoy creating secure, stable environments, and consider it an affront to have those considerations rejected \u2013 again, insubordination is not tolerated.\n\nIt\u2019s not that they have wild, high-flying hopes of perfection for their children \u2013 Executives are down-to-earth people and simply want to see their children develop into respected, responsible adults. But Executive personalities also want their children to be strong-willed and capable, and that is something that can only happen when they have the chance to make their own decisions, and the chance to face the consequences of those decisions, good or bad, with the love and support of their parents.\n\nI\u2019ve Got Big Shoes to Fill\n\nThey may face challenges as their children learn to balance a growing desire for independence with the respect and adherence to their duties required of them, but Executives do have a clear advantage of consistency and direct honesty that never leaves their expectations ambiguous. It can be a tall order, but Executives\u2019 children always know what they need to bring, and most will recognize and appreciate the dedication and hard work their parents brought in return.\n\n05"

Though there are many directions they can choose to go, people with the Executive personality type almost always end up in situations where they have the opportunity to exercise their affinity for organization, structure, and follow-through. Providing further focus, Executives share a profound respect for tradition, stability and security, qualities which lend themselves well to progressing along clear paths to increased responsibility and dependability.\n\nExecutives\u2019 sense of loyalty results in them staying with a single employer as long as possible, and their reverence for established institutions often leads to work with well-respected organizations. Law enforcement, military service, hospitals and prominent legal firms are all able to recognize Executives\u2019 long years of service.\n\nExecutive personalities rise to the occasion and meet their obligations with enviable consistency, making them clear choices for advancement.\n\nExecutives are the image of the model citizen, and they strive to maintain this ideal throughout their careers. This helps them move forward into management as well \u2013 people with this personality type have many traits inherent to leadership, something that is often recognized regardless of their chosen industry. From the genuine enjoyment Executives feel in organizing other people to their knack for clearly expressing their principles, values and expectations, Executives are extremely effective managers.\n\nAlso fearsome leaders, Executives loathe disorganization, ineptitude, laziness and especially dishonesty, and when these values are crossed, Executive personalities do not hesitate to let their disapproval show. So long as everyone plays by the rules, Executives are incredibly efficient, their love of structure and thoroughness leaving a record of accurate, complete work that is on time and on budget. Executives are natural auditors, financial officers and business administrators, and any such and similar roles are excellent choices for them.\n\nTo the Victors Belong the Spoils\n\nHard work and self-motivation are also strong Executive principles, which makes them excellent sales representatives, whether in basic retail positions, part of office teams, or as independent agents. People with the Executive personality type stick to projects until they\u2019re finished, big or small, and are organized enough to make any necessary paperwork a mere minor inconvenience to their clients, rather than some baffling ordeal. These qualities combine to make the clear steps in advancement that Executives require in order to maintain a sense of accomplishment not just viable, but almost inevitable.\n\n06"

Whether subordinates, among colleagues or as managers, people with the Executive personality type create order, follow the rules, and work to ensure that their work and the work of those around them is completed to the highest standards. Cutting corners and shirking responsibility are the quickest ways to lose Executives\u2019 respect.\n\nExecutive Subordinates\n\nExecutives are hard-working and do things by the book. Though sometimes stubborn and inflexible, especially when presented with ideas that haven\u2019t been fully developed, Executive personalities are open to new methods that can be demonstrated to be better. However, Executives are unlikely to do much experimenting on their own \u2013 adhering to stated responsibilities and fulfilling their duties is their primary concern.\n\nExecutives are also well-known for their loyalty and dedication, but in some ways this is contingent on their respect. People with this personality type are willing to voice their opinions, especially in deciding what is and is not acceptable \u2013 if provided with sensible responses that address their concerns, they are often satisfied with that. If Executives view their managers as illogical, dishonest or cowardly in their methods, they can be uncomfortably honest, if still calm and level, in voicing their opinions on that as well.\n\nExecutive Colleagues\n\nExecutives enjoy the hustle and bustle of well-organized workplaces. Honest, friendly and down-to-earth, Executive personalities are great networkers who enjoy connecting with others to get things done. Abusing this for advancement is unlikely, and is in fact something Executives frown upon. Shortcuts are irresponsible, and people with the Executive personality type lose respect quickly for those who try to push forward by showing off or promoting bold but risky ideas, making relationships with more inspiration-oriented colleagues a challenge.\n\nExecutives like to feel like they are a part of the team, and a part of the greater organization that they work for. To make sure this happens, Executives are nearly always willing to accept criticism that can help to improve their effectiveness, and always keep an eye on their surroundings to make sure they and their team deliver the results that are expected of them.\n\nExecutive Managers\n\nExecutives take genuine pleasure in organizing others into effective teams, and as managers they have no better opportunity to do so. While sometimes overbearing, even micromanaging, Executives\u2019 strong wills also serve to defend their teams and principles against diversions and cutbacks, regardless of who brings them. Laziness and bad work ethic are not tolerated by Executives under any circumstances.\n\nExecutives project natural authority, but they sometimes expect this authority to be abided unconditionally, resisting change and demanding that things be done by the book. Whether Executives\u2019 own book or the existing rules and traditions are used is subject to circumstances, but they do tend to rest on the security of tradition and precedent. Regardless, Executives\u2019 expectations are clearly expressed, leaving little room or tolerance for deviation from the agenda.\n\n07"

They are attentive and people-focused, and they enjoy taking part in their social community. Their achievements are guided by decisive values, and they willingly offer guidance to others.\n\nEncourage, lift and strengthen one another. For the positive energy spread to one will be felt by us all.\n\nDEBORAH DAY\n\nPeople who share the Consul personality type are, for lack of a better word, popular \u2013 which makes sense, given that it is also a very common personality type, making up twelve percent of the population. In high school, Consuls are the cheerleaders and the quarterbacks, setting the tone, taking the spotlight and leading their teams forward to victory and fame. Later in life, Consuls continue to enjoy supporting their friends and loved ones, organizing social gatherings and doing their best to make sure everyone is happy.\n\nAt their hearts, Consul personalities are social creatures, and thrive on staying up to date with what their friends are doing.\n\nDiscussing scientific theories or debating European politics isn\u2019t likely to capture Consuls\u2019 interest for too long. Consuls are more concerned with fashion and their appearance, their social status and the standings of other people. Practical matters and gossip are their bread and butter, but Consuls do their best to use their powers for good.\n\nRespecting the Wisdom of Leadership\n\nConsuls are altruists, and they take seriously their responsibility to help and to do the right thing. Unlike their Diplomat relatives however, people with the Consul personality type will base their moral compass on established traditions and laws, upholding authority and rules, rather than drawing their morality from philosophy or mysticism. It\u2019s important for Consuls to remember though, that people come from many backgrounds and perspectives, and what may seem right to them isn\u2019t always an absolute truth.\n\nConsuls love to be of service, enjoying any role that allows them to participate in a meaningful way, so long as they know that they are valued and appreciated. This is especially apparent at home, and Consuls make loyal and devoted partners and parents. Consul personalities respect hierarchy, and do their best to position themselves with some authority, at home and at work, which allows them to keep things clear, stable and organized for everyone.\n\nPlay Dates Aren\u2019t Just for the Kids!\n\nSupportive and outgoing, Consuls can always be spotted at a party \u2013 they\u2019re the ones finding time to chat and laugh with everyone! But their devotion goes further than just breezing through because they have to. Consuls truly enjoy hearing about their friends\u2019 relationships and activities, remembering little details and always standing ready to talk things out with warmth and sensitivity. If things aren\u2019t going right, or there\u2019s tension in the room, Consuls pick up on it and to try to restore harmony and stability to the group.\n\nBeing pretty conflict-averse, Consuls spend a lot of their energy establishing social order, and prefer plans and organized events to open-ended activities or spontaneous get-togethers. People with this personality type put a lot of effort into the activities they\u2019ve arranged, and it\u2019s easy for Consuls\u2019 feelings to be hurt if their ideas are rejected, or if people just aren\u2019t interested. Again, it\u2019s important for Consuls to remember that everyone is coming from a different place, and that disinterest isn\u2019t a comment about them or the activity they\u2019ve organized \u2013 it\u2019s just not their thing.\n\nComing to terms with their sensitivity is Consuls\u2019 biggest challenge \u2013 people are going to disagree and they\u2019re going to criticize, and while it hurts, it\u2019s just a part of life. The best thing for Consuls to do is to do what they do best: be a role model, take care of what they have the power to take care of, and enjoy that so many people do appreciate the efforts they make.\n\n01",

Consuls are true pillars of any groups they belong to \u2013 whether it is their family or a community club, people with this personality type can always be relied upon.\nSensitive and Warm \u2013 Helping to ensure that stability, Consul personalities seek harmony and care deeply about other people\u2019s feelings, being careful not to offend or hurt anybody. Consuls are strong team players, and win-win situations are the stuff smiles are made of.\nGood at Connecting with Others \u2013 These qualities come together to make Consuls social, comfortable and well-liked. Consul personalities have a strong need to \u201cbelong\u201d, and have no problem with small talk or following social cues in order to help them take an active role in their communities.\nConsul Weaknesses\nWorried about Their Social Status \u2013 These Strengths are related to a chief Weakness: Consuls\u2019 preoccupation with social status and influence, which affects many decisions they make, potentially limiting their creativity and open-mindedness.\nInflexible \u2013 Consuls place a lot of importance on what is socially acceptable, and can be very cautious, even critical of anything unconventional or outside the mainstream. People with this personality type may also sometimes push their own beliefs too hard in an effort to establish them as mainstream.\nReluctant to Innovate or Improvise \u2013 Just as they can be critical of others\u2019 \u201cunusual\u201d behavior, Consuls may also be unwilling to step out of their own comfort zones, usually for fear of being (or just appearing) different.\nVulnerable to Criticism \u2013 It can be especially challenging to change these tendencies because Consuls are so conflict-averse. Consul personalities can become very defensive and hurt if someone, especially a person close to them, criticizes their habits, beliefs or traditions.\nOften Too Needy \u2013 Consuls need to hear and see a great deal of appreciation. If their efforts go unnoticed, people with the Consul personality type may start fishing for compliments, in an attempt to get reassurance of how much they are valued.\nToo Selfless \u2013 The other side of this is that Consuls sometimes try to establish their value with doting attention, something that can quickly overwhelm those who don\u2019t need it, making it ultimately unwelcome. Furthermore, Consuls often neglect their own needs in the process.\n02"

No other kind of relationship provides people with the Consul personality type with the same level of support and devotion, and the feelings of security and stability that come with strong romantic relationships are extremely warming.\n\nConsuls don\u2019t do casual flings \u2013 they need to know that their partners will always be by their sides offering unwavering support, and marriage and family are the ultimate goal.\n\nWith such a goal in mind, Consul personalities take each stage, from dating to everything thereafter, very seriously. Everything about Consuls\u2019 relationships is based on satisfying mutual needs, from creating understanding early on to building mutual respect and support for each other\u2019s opinions and goals. Knowing that they are loved and appreciated has a huge effect on Consuls\u2019 mood and self-esteem.\n\nLive Long Enough and Everyone Makes Mistakes...\n\nIf they feel like this support isn\u2019t there, such as when their partners deliver criticism, Consuls can feel extremely hurt. People with the Consul personality type dislike conflict and criticism, which can make it challenging to address any problems that come up. Nothing is more hurtful or depressing to Consuls than to realize that their partners don\u2019t respect their dreams or opinions. Consuls can be surprisingly tough and tireless in the face of hardship, but they need to know without a doubt that their partners are behind them 100%.\n\nUnfortunately, less mature Consuls may lack the inner strength and wisdom to attract this in healthy ways. They can be very needy, compromising their own principles and values in exchange for their partners\u2019 approval. This is a terrible trap \u2013 not only is it unattractive, it can too easily lead to emotionally abusive relationships, which reduce Consuls\u2019 self-esteem further. Another snare is their fixation on social status and approval \u2013 it\u2019s not uncommon for Consuls\u2019 social circles and relatives to play a bigger part in their choice of dating partners than even their own values.\n\n...But Learning From Those Mistakes Makes a Better Person\n\nConsuls are warm, loyal people who want to feel trusted and valued. They are great with practical matters like money management and administrative tasks, and are happy to take on such responsibilities in the name of taking care of the people they care about, a wonderful quality. Consuls just need to make sure they take the time to ensure that they build relationships that allow them to satisfy their own needs and dreams, with partners who appreciate their care and generosity fully, and who reciprocate as well.\n\nConsuls are often very organized in how their relationships develop, following established dating rules and traditions (don\u2019t call first, third date, etc.). As their relationships enter more sexual stages, Consuls\u2019 emphasis on process and tradition continue with established gender roles and socially acceptable activities.\n\nHowever, since Consuls are so centered on the physical world and are quite emotional, they tend to be very affectionate and sensual, and overall great sexual partners. People with this personality type love to find ways to make their partners happy, and this sort of intimacy is a great way to do so. As the two partners become more comfortable with each other, Consuls are often open to experimenting and trying new things, so long as their partners are willing to reciprocate.\n\nConsuls have specific needs for their relationships, and certain personality types are best able to meet those needs. In general, partners should share Consuls\u2019 Observant (S) trait, but it can also be useful to develop a sense of introspection that Introverted (I) partners can provide, with maybe one more opposing trait to help Consuls focus on logical decisions when appropriate, or to be more open-minded in new situations.\n\n03"

Consuls can greatly expand their circle of friends if they learn to be more receptive to other perspectives, rather than making snap judgments and conclusions. It\u2019s important for Consuls, as with anyone, to avoid being insulated from other viewpoints and opinions, to relate to and understand ever more people.\n\nWe\u2019re All in It Together\n\nOn the other hand, Consuls are great at using their sensitivity to stay in tune with what motivates and drives their friends. While in their weaker moments, Consul personalities can sometimes use these observations to manipulate others, they are far more interested in maintaining strong relationships, and this is a great tool for doing so. Altruists that they are, Consuls almost always use their powers for good, encouraging and inspiring others.\n\nBy and large, the Consul personality type is a pleasant and sincere one. Their energy and social intelligence win them many acquaintances and friends, and their support and dedication keep those friendships close and strong. With so much zest for life and company, dull moments are sure to be few and far between.\n\n04"

Sensitive yet firm, Consul parents are able to establish rules and authority without being entirely overbearing, using their compassion and support to smooth over the occasional miscommunication or difference of opinion.\n\nHaving children is often the culmination of Consuls\u2019 life goals, and they cherish every moment of it.\n\nFrom the start, Consuls try to ensure that their children feel safe and happy. People with the Consul personality type enjoy the support they are able to give their infants, who are utterly dependent on their care. Family being as important as it is to Consuls, this is an incredibly rewarding start to the relationship.\n\nHandling Adversity Fosters Growth\n\nAs their children grow and begin to explore more, Consuls\u2019 love and care grows with them, but often becomes overprotective. Consuls may not just keep their children safe physically, but also socially, by arranging play dates, camps and other activities so much that their children aren\u2019t free to make the blunders that lead to emotional growth and social independence.\n\nConsuls value harmony and stability highly, and it\u2019s often the case that they try to use indirect pressure to try to teach life\u2019s lessons. When they are forced into a confrontation by their children\u2019s blatant wrong-doing though, Consul parents step in firmly, and expect their words to be respected. Believers in traditional roles, Consul parents view the parent-child relationship in black and white terms, with their authority as final.\n\nCharacter Is a Journey, Not a Destination\n\nAs their children grow into adolescence and begin to push away from their parents, Consuls can take this transition personally. Feeling like they are losing their children, Consul personalities sometimes try to prolong their dependence as long as possible. It\u2019s important to remember that when grown children leave the home, it\u2019s because their parents were successful in preparing them for the next phase of their lives, an accomplishment Consuls can be proud of.\n\nConsuls\u2019 children will always appreciate the sensitivity and warmth that they were raised with, and as time goes on and they have their own children, they will cherish the fact that those children have the benefit of grandparents who love and care for them unconditionally.\n\n05"

Consuls are well-organized, enjoying bringing order and structure to their workplaces, and often work best in environments with clear, predictable hierarchies and tasks. Monotony and routine work are not a challenge for the Consul personality type, as they are happy to do what needs to be done.\n\nCooperation, not Conflict\n\nCareers as administrators are a natural fit, allowing Consuls to organize not just an environment, but the people in it. Their practical skills combine well with their dependability, making Consul personalities surprisingly good accountants \u2013 though they often prefer to be personal accountants, helping people and interacting with them directly, instead of corporate accountants crunching numbers in some back room.\n\nPurely analytical careers are often too dull for Consuls though \u2013 they need human interaction and emotional feedback to be truly satisfied in their line of work. Good listeners and enthusiastic team members, people with the Consul personality type are excellent providers of medical care and social work. Teaching is another great option, as Consuls are comfortable with authority, but are supportive and friendly enough to keep that authority from feeling overbearing.\n\nConsuls\u2019 best careers all have the additional benefit of providing them with perhaps their most important requirement: to feel appreciated and know they\u2019ve helped someone.\n\nBeing as altruistic as they are, Consuls find it hard to be satisfied unless they know they\u2019ve done something valuable for another person. This is often the driving force behind Consuls\u2019 careers and career advancement, and makes religious work and counseling particularly rewarding.\n\nWhatever they choose to do, Consul personalities\u2019 comfort with busy social situations and practical knowledge and skills come together to create people who are not just able to be productive and helpful, but people who genuinely enjoy it.\n\n06"

People with the Consul personality type thrive on social order and harmony, and use their warmth and social intelligence to make sure that each person knows their responsibilities and is able to get done what needs to get done. Consuls are comfortable, even dependent on clear hierarchies and roles, and whether subordinates, colleagues or managers, Consul personalities expect authority to be respected and backed up by rules and standards.\n\nConsul Subordinates\n\nWith clearly defined responsibilities and a sense of purpose, Consuls are patient, efficient, hard-working people who respect the authority of their managers. While Consuls may struggle with too much freedom and improvisation, they thrive in workplaces with structure, safety and guidelines. Routine tasks are not a problem for Consuls, and their dedication and loyalty earn them the respect of their managers.\n\nConsul Colleagues\n\nTeamwork is a concept that Consuls have no trouble putting into practice. Often seeking friends at work, people with this personality type are almost always willing to lend a hand when and where it\u2019s needed. Excellent networkers, Consuls always seem to \u201cknow just the guy\u201d to bring a project together on time. On the other hand, Consuls often need to work on a team \u2013 being stuck alone chipping away at paperwork for days on end just leaves them tired and unfulfilled.\n\nConsuls take pride in these qualities, which has the side effect of making them particularly sensitive when they come under criticism. When their suggestions and help are turned down, Consul personalities can take it personally. Already somewhat vulnerable to stress, rejections like these can be pretty demoralizing, and Consuls may need their coworkers to make an effort to express their appreciation from time to time.\n\nConsul Managers\n\nConsuls enjoy the responsibility that comes with organizing social situations, and the enjoyment they feel in managing other people translates well into management positions. As team leaders, Consuls find ways to make everyone feel involved, uniting people and smoothing relations in order to get things done.\n\nAt the same time, Consuls have a strong respect for traditional power structures, and if after all their efforts convincing their subordinates to work together someone ends up challenging their authority, they can stress out, lose their temper, and just generally react badly. People with the Consul personality type are sensitive about their status and dislike conflict, and prefer situations where everyone knows their role. So long as expectations are clearly outlined, Consuls are effective and enjoyable managers.\n\n07"

                "content": "Introduction\n\nWHO IS A VIRTUOSO (ISTP)?\n\nA Virtuoso (ISTP) is someone with the Introverted, Observant, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits. They tend to have an individualistic mindset, pursuing goals without needing much external connection. They engage in life with inquisitiveness and personal skill, varying their approach as needed.\n\nI wanted to live the life, a different life. I didn\u2019t want to go to the same place every day and see the same people and do the same job. I wanted interesting challenges.\n\nHARRISON FORD\n\nVirtuosos love to explore with their hands and their eyes, touching and examining the world around them with cool rationalism and spirited curiosity. People with this personality type are natural Makers, moving from project to project, building the useful and the superfluous for the fun of it, and learning from their environment as they go. Often mechanics and engineers, Virtuosos find no greater joy than in getting their hands dirty pulling things apart and putting them back together, just a little bit better than they were before.\n\nVirtuosos explore ideas through creating, troubleshooting, trial and error and first-hand experience. They enjoy having other people take an interest in their projects and sometimes don\u2019t even mind them getting into their space. Of course, that\u2019s on the condition that those people don\u2019t interfere with Virtuosos\u2019 principles and freedom, and they\u2019ll need to be open to Virtuosos returning the interest in kind.\n\nVirtuosos enjoy lending a hand and sharing their experience, especially with the people they care about, and it\u2019s a shame they\u2019re so uncommon, making up only about five percent of the population. Virtuoso women are especially rare, and the typical gender roles that society tends to expect can be a poor fit \u2013 they\u2019ll often be seen as tomboys from a young age.\n\nDare to Differ\n\nWhile their mechanical tendencies can make them appear simple at a glance, Virtuosos are actually quite enigmatic. Friendly but very private, calm but suddenly spontaneous, extremely curious but unable to stay focused on formal studies, Virtuoso personalities can be a challenge to predict, even by their friends and loved ones. Virtuosos can seem very loyal and steady for a while, but they tend to build up a store of impulsive energy that explodes without warning, taking their interests in bold new directions.\n\nRather than some sort of vision quest though, Virtuosos are merely exploring the viability of a new interest when they make these seismic shifts.\n\nVirtuosos\u2019 decisions stem from a sense of practical realism, and at their heart is a strong sense of direct fairness, a \u201cdo unto others\u201d attitude, which really helps to explain many of Virtuosos\u2019 puzzling traits. Instead of being overly cautious though, avoiding stepping on toes in order to avoid having their toes stepped on, Virtuosos are likely to go too far, accepting likewise retaliation, good or bad, as fair play.\n\nThe biggest issue Virtuosos are likely to face is that they often act too soon, taking for granted their permissive nature and assuming that others are the same. They\u2019ll be the first to tell an insensitive joke, get overly involved in someone else\u2019s project, roughhouse and play around, or suddenly change their plans because something more interesting came up.\n\nNothing Is as Boring as Everyone Agreeing With You\n\nVirtuosos will come to learn that many other personality types have much more firmly drawn lines on rules and acceptable behavior than they do \u2013 they don\u2019t want to hear an insensitive joke, and certainly wouldn\u2019t tell one back, and they wouldn\u2019t want to engage in horseplay, even with a willing party. If a situation is already emotionally charged, violating these boundaries can backfire tremendously.\n\nVirtuosos have a particular difficulty in predicting emotions, but this is just a natural extension of their fairness, given how difficult it is to gauge Virtuosos\u2019 emotions and motivations. However, their tendency to explore their relationships through their actions rather than through empathy can lead to some very frustrating situations. People with the Virtuoso personality type struggle with boundaries and guidelines, preferring the freedom to move about and color outside the lines if they need to.\n\nFinding an environment where they can work with good friends who understand their style and unpredictability, combining their creativity, sense of humor and hands-on approach to build practical solutions and things, will give Virtuosos many happy years of building useful boxes \u2013 and admiring them from the outside.\n\n01",

Cheerful and good-natured, people with the Virtuoso personality type (especially Assertive ones) rarely get stressed out, preferring to go with the flow.\nCreative and Practical \u2013 Virtuosos are very imaginative when it comes to practical things, mechanics, and crafts. Novel ideas come easily, and they love using their hands to put them into action.\nSpontaneous and Rational \u2013 Combining spontaneity with logic, Virtuosos can switch mindsets to fit new situations with little effort, making them flexible and versatile individuals.\nKnow How to Prioritize \u2013 This flexibility comes with some unpredictability, but Virtuoso personalities are able to store their spontaneity for a rainy day, releasing their energy just when it\u2019s needed most.\nGreat in a Crisis \u2013 With all this hands-on creativity and spontaneity, it\u2019s no wonder that Virtuosos are naturals in crisis situations. People with this personality type usually enjoy a little physical risk, and they aren\u2019t afraid to get their hands dirty when the situation calls for it.\nRelaxed \u2013 Through all this, Virtuosos are able to stay quite relaxed. They live in the moment and go with the flow, refusing to worry too much about the future.\nVirtuoso Weaknesses\nStubborn \u2013 As easily as Virtuosos go with the flow, they can also ignore it entirely, and usually move in another direction with little apology or sensitivity. If someone tries to change Virtuosos\u2019 habits, lifestyle or ideas through criticism, they can become quite blunt in their irritation.\nInsensitive \u2013 Virtuosos use logic, and even when they try to meet others halfway with empathy and emotional sensitivity, it rarely seems to quite come out right, if anything is even said at all.\nPrivate and Reserved \u2013 Virtuoso personalities are notoriously difficult to get to know. They are true introverts, keeping their personal matters to themselves, and often just prefer silence to small talk.\nEasily Bored \u2013 Virtuosos enjoy novelty, which makes them excellent tinkerers, but much less reliable when it comes to focusing on things long-term. Once something is understood, Virtuosos tend to simply move on to something new and more interesting.\nDislike Commitment \u2013 Long-term commitments are particularly onerous for Virtuosos. They prefer to take things day-by-day, and the feeling of being locked into something for a long time is downright oppressive. This can be a particular challenge in Virtuosos\u2019 romantic relationships.\nRisky Behavior \u2013 This stubbornness, difficulty with others\u2019 emotions, focus on the moment, and easy boredom can lead to unnecessary and unhelpful boundary-pushing, just for fun. Virtuosos have been known to escalate conflict and danger just to see where it goes, something that can have disastrous consequences for everyone around if they lose control of the situation.\n02"

Dating Virtuoso personalities is a tango, complex and interesting, with alternating coldness and detachment, and passion, spontaneity and enjoyment of the moment. Nothing can be forced in Virtuoso relationships, but so long as they are given the space they need to be themselves, they will gladly enjoy the comforts of a steady partner for a lifetime.\n\nIf Songs Could Change Lives, We\u2019d All Love Each Other\n\nEarly in dating, people with the Virtuoso personality type can be especially flighty \u2013 they live in the present, always looking for new activities and experiences. If a potential partner doesn\u2019t measure up, Virtuosos have no real problem walking away. Virtuosos also need a great deal of personal space, both physically and mentally, and any attempts to control them or forcibly schedule their activities only accelerates their departure.\n\nOn the other hand, Virtuosos have no problem trying to change their partners\u2019 habits, most likely with attempts to get them to loosen up a bit and relax and have fun. Virtuoso personalities are hardly strict or traditional when it comes to dating, and often try to introduce sex into their activities early on. Sensual individuals that they are, Virtuosos make ready use of all of their senses, viewing intimacy as an art, a performance, and a source of pleasure.\n\nAs their relationships progress, Virtuosos\u2019 partners tend to find that intimacy is about the closest they get to open emotional expression. It\u2019s not that Virtuosos don\u2019t have feelings \u2013 they actually run quite deep and strong \u2013 just that they conceal and protect them because they are unsure how to deal with them and express them. Virtuosos have no trouble leaving something they think is mutually understood unsaid.\n\nThis applies in a broader sense in Virtuosos\u2019 relationships as well. Any attempts to push understood arrangements, even the relationships themselves, into open discussion in order to secure commitment, especially early on, are often met by Virtuosos with something close to panic. Nothing is so acutely terrifying to Virtuosos as knowing that there\u2019s no way out. Every day is a new day, and Virtuosos review their obligations from moment to moment.\n\nIf Virtuosos are to be lifelong partners, it must happen as a natural progression of these day-to-day decisions, on their own time.\n\nNone of this should be taken too personally by Virtuosos\u2019 partners \u2013 it\u2019s just how their minds work. People with this personality type live in the present, in a world of physical activities that engage the senses, and they just need to know that they have the freedom to be passionate about something one day and indifferent the next, without being grilled on when they\u2019re going to finish something, or why they\u2019ve \u201csuddenly changed their minds\u201d.\n\nAt the same time, being a little more expressive and a little more comfortable with the idea of consistency and follow-through can go a long way in rounding out the Virtuoso personality type. The best partners usually share Virtuosos\u2019 Observant (S) trait, that interest in what the world is here and now, with one or two opposing traits to help them to explore a world that also involves other people and others\u2019 expectations.\n\n03"

With their well-rounded and interesting array of hobbies, people with the Virtuoso personality type have no trouble at all making acquaintances to share their activities with. It\u2019s getting beneath the surface to become Virtuosos\u2019 true friends that is the real challenge, leaving them with a lot of good will and friendly faces to call on, but only a few people who they feel truly understand them.\n\nMaybe... But Not Today\n\nA lot of this comes down to Virtuosos simply not wanting to be bound to any particular person or activity. Virtuoso personalities live in the present, enjoying whatever life brings, and feel no real obligation to shift course on account of others\u2019 plans. If friends don\u2019t want to do what Virtuosos are doing, then they are free to go do their own thing, and they\u2019ll hang out some other time. Sometimes their shifts in attitude can catch their friends flat-footed, but Virtuosos\u2019 motto remains \u201ceverything can be changed\u201d. Forcing them to constantly commit to scheduled activities is probably the quickest way to end these friendships.\n\nAs long as everyone keeps things relaxed and flexible though, Virtuosos\u2019 friendships can be rich and rewarding. People with this personality type are talented when it comes to using their senses, and usually enjoy a little competition. This makes Virtuosos\u2019 hobbies, especially the more physical activities like fishing and crafts, especially enjoyable with a little company, and they are usually the basis for their friendships. Virtuosos\u2019 interests are pretty diverse, so they should have no trouble coming up with exciting things to do.\n\nVirtuoso personalities are also thoughtful, rational people. Being fairly creative individuals themselves, they often enjoy discussing new ideas \u2013 but in the end, the point of sharing those ideas needs to be to take action. Dreaming is well and good, but talk is cheap, and discussions on abstract or distant subjects like Eurasian politics can only hold Virtuosos\u2019 attention for so long before they decide to shift their focus to something they can do.\n\nThis makes friendships with Intuitive (N) types, who have a much less physical approach to life, challenging for Virtuosos to maintain. With their enjoyment of firsthand experience, these personalities just feel more comfortable alongside other personality types with the Observant (S) trait. So long as they share a hobby, philosophical differences and contrasting world views really don\u2019t matter too much \u2013 it\u2019s what people do that matters to Virtuosos.\n\nI Never Set Out to Be Weird, and yet...\n\nVirtuosos are unusually popular, almost in spite of themselves. Their open-mindedness, interesting hobbies and relaxed attitude are attractive to a remarkably broad range of personality types. With so many acquaintances, Virtuosos are sure to strike up deeper friendships with at least a few.\n\n04"

It\u2019s a big world out there, meant to be explored and experienced. Nothing is quite as perplexing to Virtuoso parents as their children sitting inside and watching television all day. Relaxed, open-minded and flexible, Virtuoso personalities expect their children to use their freedom wisely \u2013 that is, to exploit it in the name of exploration and experience.\n\nThe World Is Your Oyster\n\nEarly in life, this attitude is tremendously beneficial for Virtuosos\u2019 children. At this age, every little thing is a miracle, to be explored with every sense. Blocks don\u2019t just have distinct colors and shapes, but smells and tastes too, and this sort of sensory exploration is right up Virtuosos\u2019 alley. As their children learn their motor skills, people with the Virtuoso personality type are happy to stack those blocks right along with them. As their children grow and develop more complex abilities, Virtuosos find joy in showing them how to use real tools to build real things.\n\nIf Virtuosos\u2019 growing children share their basic qualities of spontaneity and passion for physical activities, they are happy to accompany them on just about any activity, be it sports, hiking or hobby engineering. None of this is anything that gets forced on their children though. Virtuosos see little need in imparting their principles and interests on their children, instead just enjoying that their children enjoy doing things.\n\nEnsuring that Virtuosos\u2019 children are responsible enough to not do anything life-alteringly reckless in their teenage years, though, often falls to luck or (with luck) a more security-oriented partner.\n\nWhere Virtuoso parents struggle most, as with their other relationships, is in emotional bonding. Emotional control is something that children learn and adapt to over years, and comparatively unemotional Virtuosos are often left at a loss for what to do in the meantime. Virtuosos may just need to rely on a more able partner. Otherwise, it takes a great deal of conscious effort on their part to be able to provide the sort of emotional understanding and support their children need.\n\n05"

This makes Virtuosos one of the most mysterious personality types, but also one of the most versatile in the professional world.\n\nVirtuosos are born problem-solvers with an unwavering focus on practical solutions (though perhaps not always solutions to practical problems). No other type is quite as fascinated by how things work, how tools can be used, and how facts can be put together to create immediate and satisfying results. This combination of curiosity and hands-on vigor make people with the Virtuoso personality type excellent mechanics, engineers, graphic designers, and forensic scientists.\n\nAbstract theory and purely academic work that will never see the light of real use hold little interest for Virtuosos.\n\n\u201cPractical\u201d is the word of the day. But it\u2019s not the practicality of routine administration that Virtuosos crave \u2013 they need variety and action, perhaps even a little adrenaline in their work. Highly structured environments leave Virtuoso personalities bored and tired. Jobs that focus on crisis response, such as firefighters, paramedics, detectives, pilots and police officers seem made for Virtuosos.\n\nPerhaps most important to Virtuosos though, is the feeling that they aren\u2019t stuck. The freedom to wander, the freedom to declare their own schedules, their own responsibilities, their own environments \u2013 nearly every other consideration pales by comparison to the need to avoid inflexible commitments and stodgy colleagues. While this can be a significant hurdle to overcome in traditional employment, it is the chiefest allure of entrepreneurship.\n\nDo Whatever Makes Your Heart Sing\n\nNearly any creative or constructive skill or interest can be offered on a freelance basis or on a business-owner\u2019s own terms, be it blogger, systems analyst, athlete or driver. Virtuosos need to face down their weak long-term planning abilities and preference for instant results in order to make this path work, but livelihoods can be made selling bits and crafts in their free time. It\u2019s also possible to find more traditional work to satisfy these needs, and forest ranger is a sought-after line of work for many Virtuosos.\n\nVirtuosos have a natural skill with troubleshooting, a relaxed, self-confident nature and a results-oriented focus. People with this personality type understand that risk equals reward, and as long as they can use that understanding with maturity, rather than just kicking the ant\u2019s nest whenever they get bored, they are highly desirable in any dynamic field or environment.\n\n06"

                "content": "Workplace Habits\n\nWhen it comes to the workplace, Virtuosos\u2019 top requirement is often a sense of unpredictability and excitement. This quality makes Virtuoso personalities\u2019 personal relationships challenging enough, even among close friends and immediate family \u2013 for those they\u2019ve only come to know in a professional environment, it can be downright frustrating.\n\nOf course, this all comes down to knowing what makes them tick. With a little space and a hands-on problem to solve, Virtuosos can be some of the most productive people around. As with anyone, forcing people with the Virtuoso personality type into a mold that doesn\u2019t fit just doesn\u2019t work. Recognizing their unique perspective and gifts can lead to extraordinary results.\n\nVirtuoso Subordinates\n\nAs subordinates, what Virtuosos crave most is a little wiggle room. Relaxed and easy-going, people with the Virtuoso personality type are happy to stick around with surprising loyalty, as long as their employers and managers don\u2019t try to force them to commit to anything that can\u2019t be undone the next day. Strict rules, guidelines and formal agreements make Virtuosos feel cramped and bored. If their habits or methods come under criticism or are forced to change, Virtuosos can also be surprisingly mulish.\n\nSomething that\u2019s likely to make Virtuosos\u2019 day is a random list of things that need to be fixed or dealt with. Virtuoso personalities have a talent for conserving their energy for just such an occasion, and can tackle such a laundry list with surprising enthusiasm. Their tasks do need to be hands-on though \u2013 if the items all start with \u201cCome up with a strategy to...\u201d, it\u2019s probably better to find an Analyst type.\n\nVirtuoso Colleagues\n\nVirtuosos are often much more liked by their colleagues than they would expect. Quiet and reserved, people with this personality type usually need a little physical space, but at the same time enjoy peeking in on others\u2019 work to see if there\u2019s anything interesting going on. Not naturally emotional or empathetic, Virtuosos have a blunt way of communicating that can lead to misunderstandings or hurt feelings.\n\nYet, Virtuosos combine this rationalism and reserve with a sense of spontaneity that, among other things, creates a lighthearted sense of \u201cdo unto others\u201d fairness. Turnabout is always fair play, and the odd prank, and the retaliation, are usually enjoyed by all. Virtuosos have a great sense of humor, if sometimes a little risqu\u00e9, and are not only resistant to workplace conflicts, but are great at defusing them with a well-placed joke that puts it all into perspective.\n\nVirtuoso Managers\n\nVirtuoso managers treat their subordinates as they\u2019d like to be treated: with minimal talking and loose boundaries. Virtuosos aren\u2019t big on chattiness or emotional expression, and more sensitive types may see them as cold and distant \u2013 effusive praise and back-slapping just isn\u2019t in Virtuosos\u2019 nature. In fact, there isn\u2019t likely to be a lot of feedback at all from Virtuoso managers, good or bad. But when problems do arise, they are great listeners who devise practical, fair, and impartial solutions.\n\n07"

                "content": "Introduction\n\nWHO IS AN ADVENTURER (ISFP)?\n\nAn Adventurer (ISFP) is a person with the Introverted, Observant, Feeling, and Prospecting personality traits. They tend to have open minds, approaching life, new experiences, and people with grounded warmth. Their ability to stay in the moment helps them uncover exciting potentials.\n\nI change during the course of a day. I wake and I\u2019m one person, and when I go to sleep I know for certain I\u2019m somebody else.\n\nBOB DYLAN\n\nAdventurer personalities are true artists, but not necessarily in the typical sense where they\u2019re out painting happy little trees. Often enough though, they are perfectly capable of this. Rather, it\u2019s that they use aesthetics, design and even their choices and actions to push the limits of social convention. Adventurers enjoy upsetting traditional expectations with experiments in beauty and behavior \u2013 chances are, they\u2019ve expressed more than once the phrase \u201cDon\u2019t box me in!\u201d\n\nHappy to Be Who They Are\n\nAdventurers live in a colorful, sensual world, inspired by connections with people and ideas. These personalities take joy in reinterpreting these connections, reinventing and experimenting with both themselves and new perspectives. No other type explores and experiments in this way more. This creates a sense of spontaneity, making Adventurers seem unpredictable, even to their close friends and loved ones.\n\nDespite all this, Adventurers are definitely Introverts, surprising their friends further when they step out of the spotlight to be by themselves to recharge. Just because they are alone though, doesn\u2019t mean people with the Adventurer personality type sit idle \u2013 they take this time for introspection, assessing their principles. Rather than dwelling on the past or the future, Adventurers think about who they are. They return from their cloister, transformed.\n\nAdventurers live to find ways to push their passions. Riskier behaviors like gambling and extreme sports are more common with this personality type than with others. Fortunately their attunement to the moment and their environment allows them to do better than most. Adventurers also enjoy connecting with others, and have a certain irresistible charm.\n\nAdventurers always know just the compliment to soften a heart that\u2019s getting ready to call their risks irresponsible or reckless.\n\nHowever, if a criticism does get through, it can end poorly. Some Adventurers can handle kindly phrased commentary, valuing it as another perspective to help push their passions in new directions. But if the comments are more biting and less mature, Adventurer personalities can lose their tempers in spectacular fashion.\n\nAdventurers are sensitive to others\u2019 feelings and value harmony. When faced with criticism, it can be a challenge for people with this type to step away from the moment long enough to not get caught up in the heat of the moment. But living in the moment goes both ways, and once the heightened emotions of an argument cool, Adventurers can usually call the past the past and move on as though it never occurred.\n\nMeaning Is in Every Expression of Life\n\nThe biggest challenge facing Adventurers is planning for the future. Finding constructive ideals to base their goals on and working out goals that create positive principles is no small task. Adventurers don\u2019t plan their futures in terms of assets and retirement. Rather, they plan actions and behaviors as contributions to a sense of identity, building a portfolio of experiences, not stocks.\n\nIf these goals and principles are noble, Adventurers can act with amazing charity and selflessness \u2013 but it can also happen that people with the Adventurer personality type establish a more self-centered identity, acting with selfishness, manipulation and egoism. It\u2019s important for Adventurers to remember to actively become the person they want to be. Developing and maintaining a new habit may not come naturally, but taking the time each day to understand their motivations allows Adventurers to use their strengths to pursue whatever they\u2019ve come to love.\n\n01",

While it\u2019s hard to explain this quality on a resume, this vivid imagination and exploratory spirit help Adventurers in unexpected ways.\nPassionate \u2013 Beneath Adventurers\u2019 quiet shyness beats an intensely feeling heart. When people with this personality type are caught up in something exciting and interesting, they can leave everything else in the dust.\nCurious \u2013 Ideas are well and good, but Adventurers need to see and explore for themselves whether their ideas ring true. Work revolving around the sciences may seem a poor match for their traits, but a boldly artistic and humanistic vision is often exactly what research needs to move forward \u2013 if Adventurers are given the freedom they need to do so.\nArtistic \u2013 Adventurers are able to show their creativity in tangible ways and with stunning beauty. Whether writing a song, painting an emotion, or presenting a statistic in a graph, Adventurers have a way of visualizing things that resonates with their audience.\nAdventurer Weaknesses\nFiercely Independent \u2013 Freedom of expression is often Adventurers\u2019 top priority. Anything that interferes with that, like traditions and hard rules, creates a sense of oppression for Adventurer personalities. This can make more rigidly structured academics and work a challenge.\nUnpredictable \u2013 Adventurers\u2019 dislike long-term commitments and plans. The tendency to actively avoid planning for the future can cause strain in Adventurers\u2019 romantic relationships and financial hardship later in life.\nEasily Stressed \u2013 Adventurers live in the present, full of emotion. When situations get out of control, people with this personality type (especially Turbulent ones) can shut down, losing their characteristic charm and creativity in favor of gnashing teeth.\nOverly Competitive \u2013 Adventurers can escalate small things into intense competitions, turning down long-term success in their search for glory in the moment, and are unhappy when they lose.\nFluctuating Self-Esteem \u2013 It\u2019s demanded that skills be quantified, but that\u2019s hard to do with Adventurers\u2019 strengths of sensitivity and artistry. Adventurers\u2019 efforts are often dismissed, a hurtful and damaging blow, especially early in life. Adventurers can start to believe the naysayers without strong support.\n02"

While very emotional individuals, they guard this sensitive core carefully, preferring to listen than to express. People with the Adventurer personality type focus instead on their partners, with little interest in dictating the mood of a situation with their own feelings. While this can sometimes be frustrating, if they are accepted for who they are, Adventurers prove to be warm, enthusiastic partners.\n\nThings are unlikely to ever grow stale \u2013 even the longest-term partners can be surprised by the secrets Adventurers keep.\n\nAs their relationships grow, Adventurers\u2019 partners come to find vibrancy and spontaneity to be par for the course. Adventurers may not be great long-term planners, preferring to let their partners take the lead when it comes to logic and strategy, but they almost never run out of things to do in the present. Also caring and loyal, Adventurers love finding ways to surprise their partners in fun little ways.\n\nThere\u2019s also a sense of practicality to Adventurers\u2019 unpredictability \u2013 if anyone is going to cancel a planned trip to stay home with a partner who suddenly got the flu as a gesture of affection, it is Adventurer personalities. Spending time with their partners is something Adventurers really enjoy, and they want their partners to know that they are cared for and special.\n\nKnowing You Are Loved, You Can Do Anything\n\nIt\u2019s important for their partners to make it clear that this love and attention is valued. Adventurers would never ask for such thanks, but it can really hurt their feelings if they don\u2019t hear it. Such expressions don\u2019t have to be verbal \u2013 Adventurers believe in actions, not words \u2013 but it\u2019s crucial that they know their feelings are shared. On the other side of the spectrum, there are few types more vulnerable to criticism and conflict, and it\u2019s necessary to provide a certain level of emotional support.\n\nIf they do feel appreciated, Adventurers are more than happy to reciprocate in any way they know how. People with the Adventurer personality type are very sensual, and in no aspect of their lives is this clearer than in their sex lives. Intimacy is an opportunity for Adventurers to satisfy their partners, and they involve every sense available in enjoying these moments. Adventurers may be shy in public, but alone with a partner they trust, the masks come off \u2013 few people get to see this side, and it\u2019s always a pleasant surprise.\n\nLove From the Soul\n\nFeelings and emotions underpin every aspect of Adventurers\u2019 relationships, alongside not just a tendency towards, but a need for, fresh possibilities. Adventurer personalities are not to be forced into anything, and rushing long-term commitments is a sure way to scare them off. If Adventurers can\u2019t feel excited in wondering \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d every morning, they may find themselves wondering \u201cwhat\u2019s the point?\u201d\n\nStill, developing some skill with planning can be a healthy area of growth for Adventurers. Learning to be a little more comfortable with voicing their feelings and communicating more clearly is something their partners can also help with. In any case, sharing the Observant (S) trait usually smooths out the more challenging aspects of mutual understanding, and relationships with people who have the Extraverted (E) and Judging (J) traits helps Adventurers to learn and grow in real, attainable ways.\n\n03"

Laid back and spontaneous, people with the Adventurer personality type won\u2019t bog things down with arguments or structured long-term plans. Intellectually exhausting pastimes like debates over European economic policy won\u2019t hold their attention long. The here-and-now is what\u2019s important to Adventurers, and they love spending time with their friends doing casual, fun activities.\n\nI Don\u2019t Want to Talk, I Want to Play!\n\nAdventurer personalities believe in actions, not words. They talk about what is, not what could, should or will be, and then they actually do it. This passion for action is a blessing for Adventurers, since it helps them get past their shyness in meeting new people. Adventurers are sensitive, much more so than most, and it takes time to build enough trust with new friends to open up and feel natural.\n\nIf new acquaintances start things out by explaining \u201cYou\u2019d do way better if...\u201d, it\u2019s unlikely they will ever be close \u2013 Adventurers just take these remarks too personally for comfort. People with this personality type are happy to get along with just about anyone, but potential friends need to ease up on being too judgmental or demanding.\n\nIf their friends keep things supportive and easy-going, Adventurers are happy to return the favor with added warmth and laughter. When they\u2019re with friends they trust, Adventurers know how to relax, shedding rules, traditions and expectations in favor of just enjoying themselves.\n\nThose who prefer safe, structured environments might end up struggling in these friendships though, especially if they lecture Adventurers on how they\u2019re living their lives. As with any criticism, those friends are free to do their own thing, and to leave Adventurers to do theirs.\n\nAdventurers\u2019 relaxed, non-judgmental attitudes make it easy for them to get along with others, but it\u2019s not always the same way around.\n\nLots of personal space and freedom are essential to Adventurer personalities, and it\u2019s often other Explorer types, who share their \u201clive and let live\u201d worldview and joy in actually doing things, that gravitate towards Adventurers.

While no one could be said to be truly prepared for such a task, Adventurer personalities\u2019 natural warmth, practicality and relaxed nature help them to settle in and appreciate every moment of joy and hardship that comes with raising a child.\n\nChildren Show the Divine in Everyone\n\nAdventurers\u2019 greatest strength is arguably the joy they take in being with and helping their loved ones. Practical needs are taken care of from day one, and Adventurers\u2019 children can always count on something exciting to do or to learn every day. People with the Adventurer personality type love fun, hands-on activities, and as their children grow, they\u2019re often encouraged to pick up extra hobbies that revolve around those kinds of activities.\n\nEven as those extra activities grow, Adventurers often defy their Introversion (I), spending time with their children and enjoying engaging activities that center on quality time. Impromptu trips, home improvement projects like repainting bedrooms, or simply baking some treats together are all likely to being fond memories for Adventurers\u2019 children.\n\nNone of this is to say that Adventurer parents are overbearing \u2013 in fact, they are one of the most relaxed personality types there is when it comes to parenting. Adventurers believe that the only way to really have their children grow up to be open-minded and well-balanced people is to let them explore and experience new things, make mistakes and learn from them, and to always know that they\u2019ll be able to come home at the end of it.\n\nInterventions and hardline rules just aren\u2019t Adventurers\u2019 style.\n\nThe freedom Adventurers grant their children comes with risks too, since it demands a certain level of maturity from the children themselves. Some lessons are harder than others. These can be hard lessons for people with the Adventurer personality type too, since they are more sensitive than most when it comes to their lifestyles or parenting being criticized. Nothing\u2019s quite as unpleasant as \u201cI told you so\u201d.\n\nLong-term planning is another challenging area for Adventurer parents. When it comes to things like saving for their children\u2019s college education, Adventurers necessarily rely on partners who take care of that sort of thing more readily.\n\nNever Stop Loving\n\nAs their children grow into adolescence, Adventurers sometimes struggle as well. Adventurer personalities need to know that their work and effort are appreciated, something teenagers aren\u2019t well-known for expressing. It can take a lot of practice on Adventurers\u2019 parts to learn the emotional control necessary to not overreact when things don\u2019t go the way they want. Children make an effort to distance themselves at that age, and private individuals or no, Adventurers need to know that their loved ones are by their sides.\n\nIn the end though, Adventurers are so much less likely to create the kinds of divides that other more rigid personality types sometimes drive between themselves and their children. There\u2019s always going to be some push from developing adults, but with such warm, caring parents, Adventurers\u2019 children can always rest assured that they know where home and hearth are.\n\n05"

Wealth, power, structure, advancement and security are all lesser goals to Adventurer personalities\u2019 greatest need: creative freedom. Adventurers crave a tangible outlet for their imagination, a chance to express themselves artistically.\n\nThose placing their emphasis on predictability and long-term planning find that attempts to push those views on Adventurers are about as effective as forcing open flames to point downwards.\n\nPeople with the Adventurer personality type are passionate experimenters, and whether they\u2019re aware of it or not, they are renowned trendsetters. With their unique perspective and simple desire to be themselves, Adventurers are natural artists, musicians and photographers, as well as designers of all stripes. Setting up shop on websites like Etsy is far more alluring to Adventurers than the confines of 9-5 administrative work in some fluorescent cubicle.\n\nDon\u2019t Work at Being Ordinary\n\nAdventurers loathe sitting idle in colorless, unchanging environments. They are free souls and need flexibility, opportunities for improvisation, and immersive work that engages every sense. If they combine these needs with their competitive nature, Adventurer personalities make great solo athletes. Adventurers prefer to live in the moment, believing the here and now is what matters most.\n\nThis quality does have the drawback of sometimes making Adventurers reckless and shortsighted, though those pitfalls aren\u2019t set in stone. An emphasis on practical, tangible things, objects that can be seen and touched, comes at the cost of ignoring less tangible ideas. Adventurers often feel that they have little control over processes like retirement planning \u2013 they can\u2019t predict the future, so it does no good to worry about it now.\n\nLife\u2019s too Short for Us to Bore Ourselves\n\nThis mindset can hold them back from many of their ideal careers, such as psychology, counseling and teaching, which require long-term planning and often extensive certifications to get started. It takes a great deal of energy for Adventurers to maintain focus on a single goal like that for so long, but it can make the day-to-day so much more rewarding for the rest of their lives.\n\nAn easier route revolves around freelance and consulting work in just about any industry that Adventurers enjoy. Whether organizing charity events, working with hospitals to make patients\u2019 stays more pleasant, or laying stone to help make a house a home, Adventurers always seem to find a way to make the world a little more beautiful and exciting, and to make a living in the process.\n\n06"

                "content": "Workplace Habits\n\nIn the workplace, Adventurers seek out positions that give them as much wiggle room as possible to do things their own way. Button-down environments that revolve around tightly held traditions and strictly enforced procedures are unlikely to appeal to Adventurer personalities. Spontaneous, charming, and genuinely fun people to be around, Adventurers just want a chance to express those natural qualities, and to know that their efforts are appreciated.\n\nAdventurer Subordinates\n\nPeople with the Adventurer personality type don\u2019t like to be controlled, and this can be quite clear in subordinate positions \u2013 they loathe being micromanaged. At the same time, Adventurers aren\u2019t well-known for their long-term focus, but rather their adaptability and spontaneity. They\u2019ll use unconventional methods, sometimes risky ones, and existing rules are just someone else\u2019s way of doing things. Still, Adventurers find a way to make things happen. To manage Adventurer personalities successfully, there need to be clearly set goals, and otherwise an open sandbox.\n\nIf this balance can be made to work, Adventurers show themselves to be eager learners and passionate problem-solvers, especially if they get to deal one-on-one with other people or to tackle a problem solo. People with this personality type are humble, even shy, and unlikely to put themselves on the spot by volunteering their help. But Adventurers do love to feel appreciated, and if assigned a task, they work hard to earn that appreciation.\n\nAdventurer Colleagues\n\nAmong their peers Adventurers feel most comfortable. Working with equals and giving some advice in order to solve practical problems is right where Adventurer personalities like to be. While they may exhaust themselves if their role requires an excessive amount of social interaction, they are otherwise quite charming and have excellent networking skills.\n\nAdventurers are tolerant and friendly, and usually just do what needs to be done regardless of whether their colleagues pull their own weight. At the end of the day though, Adventurers are sensitive and need to know that these efforts are appreciated \u2013 a well-placed compliment goes a long way. Adventurers do let their personal goals affect their approach to their work, which can make them a little unpredictable, but this is balanced by their desire for harmony and willingness to find win-win solutions whenever possible.\n\nAdventurer Managers\n\nThe position that feels most unnatural to Adventurers is management. They are not a domineering personality type, and take no joy in exerting control over others, planning long-term goals, or disciplining unsatisfactory behavior. But just because it feels a little strange, doesn\u2019t mean Adventurer personalities aren\u2019t good at it.\n\nAdventurers\u2019 sensitivity allows them to be great listeners, helping them to align their subordinates\u2019 personal motivations with the task at hand. They also give their subordinates the freedom to do what needs to be done to solve what needs to be solved on any given day, and Adventurers are likely to dig into that work right alongside them. This gives Adventurer managers a marked style of inspiration and cooperation, and they\u2019re usually well-liked.\n\n07"

                "content": "Introduction\n\nWHO IS AN ENTREPRENEUR (ESTP)?\n\nAn Entrepreneur (ESTP) is someone with the Extraverted, Observant, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits. They tend to be energetic and action-oriented, deftly navigating whatever is in front of them. They love uncovering life\u2019s opportunities, whether socializing with others or in more personal pursuits.\n\nLife is either a daring adventure or nothing at all.\n\nHELEN KELLER\n\nEntrepreneurs always have an impact on their immediate surroundings \u2013 the best way to spot them at a party is to look for the whirling eddy of people flitting about them as they move from group to group. Laughing and entertaining with a blunt and earthy humor, Entrepreneur personalities love to be the center of attention. If an audience member is asked to come on stage, Entrepreneurs volunteer \u2013 or volunteer a shy friend.\n\nTheory, abstract concepts and plodding discussions about global issues and their implications don\u2019t keep Entrepreneurs interested for long. Entrepreneurs keep their conversation energetic, with a good dose of intelligence, but they like to talk about what is \u2013 or better yet, to just go out and do it. Entrepreneurs leap before they look, fixing their mistakes as they go, rather than sitting idle, preparing contingencies and escape clauses.\n\nNever Confuse Movement With Action\n\nEntrepreneurs are the likeliest personality type to make a lifestyle of risky behavior. They live in the moment and dive into the action \u2013 they are the eye of the storm. People with the Entrepreneur personality type enjoy drama, passion, and pleasure, not for emotional thrills, but because it\u2019s so stimulating to their logical minds. They are forced to make critical decisions based on factual, immediate reality in a process of rapid-fire rational stimulus response.\n\nThis makes school and other highly organized environments a challenge for Entrepreneurs. It certainly isn\u2019t because they aren\u2019t smart, and they can do well, but the regimented, lecturing approach of formal education is just so far from the hands-on learning that Entrepreneurs enjoy. It takes a great deal of maturity to see this process as a necessary means to an end, something that creates more exciting opportunities.\n\nAlso challenging is that to Entrepreneurs, it makes more sense to use their own moral compass than someone else\u2019s. Rules were made to be broken. This is a sentiment few high school instructors or corporate supervisors are likely to share, and can earn Entrepreneur personalities a certain reputation. But if they minimize the trouble-making, harness their energy, and focus through the boring stuff, Entrepreneurs are a force to be reckoned with.\n\nMost People Don\u2019t Listen Well Enough\n\nWith perhaps the most perceptive, unfiltered view of any type, Entrepreneurs have a unique skill in noticing small changes. Whether a shift in facial expression, a new clothing style, or a broken habit, people with this personality type pick up on hidden thoughts and motives where most types would be lucky to pick up anything specific at all. Entrepreneurs use these observations immediately, calling out the change and asking questions, often with little regard for sensitivity. Entrepreneurs should remember that not everyone wants their secrets and decisions broadcast.\n\nSometimes Entrepreneurs\u2019 instantaneous observation and action is just what\u2019s required, as in some corporate environments, and especially in emergencies.\n\nIf Entrepreneurs aren\u2019t careful though, they may get too caught in the moment, take things too far, and run roughshod over more sensitive people, or forget to take care of their own health and safety. Making up only four percent of the population, there are just enough Entrepreneurs out there to keep things spicy and competitive, and not so many as to cause a systemic risk.\n\nEntrepreneurs are full of passion and energy, complemented by a rational, if sometimes distracted, mind. Inspiring, convincing and colorful, they are natural group leaders, pulling everyone along the path less traveled, bringing life and excitement everywhere they go. Putting these qualities to a constructive and rewarding end is Entrepreneurs\u2019 true challenge.\n\n01",

There is no greater joy for Entrepreneurs than pushing boundaries and discovering and using new things and ideas.\nRational and Practical \u2013 Entrepreneurs love knowledge and philosophy, but not for their own sake. What\u2019s fun for Entrepreneur personalities is finding ideas that are actionable and drilling into the details so they can put them to use. If a discussion is completely arbitrary, there are better uses for Entrepreneurs\u2019 time.\nOriginal \u2013 Combining their boldness and practicality, Entrepreneurs love to experiment with new ideas and solutions. They put things together in ways no one else would think to.\nPerceptive \u2013 This originality is helped by Entrepreneurs\u2019 ability to notice when things change \u2013 and when they need to change! Small shifts in habits and appearances stick out to Entrepreneurs, and they use these observations to help create connections with others.\nDirect \u2013 This perceptive skill isn\u2019t used for mind games \u2013 Entrepreneurs prefer to communicate clearly, with direct and factual questions and answers. Things are what they are.\nSociable \u2013 All these qualities pull together to make a natural group leader in Entrepreneurs. This isn\u2019t something that they actively seek \u2013 people with this personality type just have a knack for making excellent use of social interactions and networking opportunities.\nEntrepreneur Weaknesses\nInsensitive \u2013 Feelings and emotions come second to facts and \u201creality\u201d for Entrepreneurs. Emotionally charged situations are awkward, uncomfortable affairs, and Entrepreneurs\u2019 blunt honesty doesn\u2019t help here. These personalities often have a lot of trouble acknowledging and expressing their own feelings as well.\nImpatient \u2013 Entrepreneurs move at their own pace to keep themselves excited. Slowing down because someone else \u201cdoesn\u2019t get it\u201d or having to stay focused on a single detail for too long is extremely challenging for Entrepreneurs.\nRisk-prone \u2013 This impatience can lead Entrepreneurs to push into uncharted territory without thinking of the long-term consequences. Entrepreneur personalities sometimes intentionally combat boredom with extra risk.\nUnstructured \u2013 Entrepreneurs see an opportunity \u2013 to fix a problem, to advance, to have fun \u2013 and seize the moment, often ignoring rules and social expectations in the process. This may get things done, but it can create unexpected social fallout.\nMay Miss the Bigger Picture \u2013 Living in the moment can cause Entrepreneurs to miss the forest for the trees. People with this personality type love to solve problems here and now, perhaps too much. All parts of a project can be perfect, but the project will still fail if those parts do not fit together.\nDefiant \u2013 Entrepreneurs won\u2019t be boxed in. Repetition, hardline rules, sitting quietly while they are lectured at \u2013 this isn\u2019t how Entrepreneurs live their lives. They are action-oriented and hands-on. Environments like school and much entry-level work can be so tedious that they\u2019re intolerable, requiring extraordinary effort from Entrepreneurs to stay focused long enough to get to freer positions.\n02"

Life is fun and full of surprises (something Entrepreneurs have particular skill in delivering), and they enjoy it all in the here and now. Entrepreneurs may not spend a lot of time planning for \u201csomeday\u201d, but their enthusiasm and unpredictability make them thrilling dating partners.\n\nEntrepreneurs\u2019 relationships are far from boring. Their improvisational style creates a seemingly never-ending list of activities and hobbies to be involved in, and Entrepreneurs fully encourage their partners to partake.\n\nEntrepreneurs love new ideas and the occasional philosophical discussion \u2013 but they need to be topics that can explored through action together, not just idle talk. There\u2019s musing about the causes and effects of epidemic obesity, and there\u2019s training for a marathon together to promote healthy living.\n\nAs Good as Spring Itself\n\nSexually, Entrepreneurs have no real reservations. It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s physically enjoyable, new ideas are always welcome, and Entrepreneur personalities\u2019 strong perception keeps them well-tuned to their partners\u2019 needs. However, Entrepreneurs\u2019 separation of the physical act from the more emotional and spiritual connections that many other types look for in intimacy can be a serious source of tension if everybody isn\u2019t on the same page. Some types need sex to be a genuine expression of love \u2013 Entrepreneurs just aren\u2019t one of them.\n\nAs time passes, it can be challenging for Entrepreneurs to move their relationships to deeper, more emotionally intimate levels. Easily bored, people with the Entrepreneur personality type seek constant excitement \u2013 sometimes even intentionally exposing themselves to risk if they feel stuck. If their partners aren\u2019t able to keep up, Entrepreneurs may just end up looking for someone new. It\u2019s not that Entrepreneur personalities are unfaithful. Rather, they may think to themselves \u201cThis isn\u2019t working, so why should I pretend it is?\u201d Entrepreneurs are rational, and can exercise self-control if they choose, but being as charming and popular as they are, it can sometimes be a little too easy to move on.\n\nTravel Only With Those You Love\n\nAs with any relationship, it takes work and patience. Not every day can be a thrill a minute. But Entrepreneurs are adaptable, curious individuals, which certainly helps to keep the flame burning. Maintaining healthy relationships is the ultimate chance for Entrepreneurs to exercise their talents in perceiving every change in their partners\u2019 mood and behavior, while also using their problem-solving abilities to address their needs. Entrepreneurs can also strengthen more neglected traits, like emotional sensitivity and long-term planning.\n\n03"

With an enviable imagination and invigorating sense of spontaneity, Entrepreneurs are never boring. They love exploring interesting ideas, both in discussion and by going out and seeing for themselves, which means that Entrepreneurs always seem to have some fun activity hidden up their sleeves. At the same time, Entrepreneur personalities are easy-going, tolerant, and charming, making them naturally quite popular.\n\nWhen I Have an Idea, I Turn Down the Flame...\n\nHands-on, physical activities like team sports are Entrepreneurs\u2019 idea of fun, and these environments give them plenty of chances to make new friends. There is little difficulty for Entrepreneurs here \u2013 they seem to get along with just about everyone, and make new friends wherever they go. Entrepreneurs live in the moment, and as a naturally confident personality type (especially if they are Assertive as well), they don\u2019t worry much about what others think of them. This attracts friends who share their attitude and zest for life.\n\nWhile not opposed to long philosophical discussions, and often enjoying the intellectual exercise, Entrepreneurs are unlikely to develop friendships based solely around one-on-one discussions about European economic challenges and the role of religion in politics. Straightforward to the point of being blunt, Entrepreneurs call it like they see it, and an honest opinion in debate is a sure thing. But at their hearts, Entrepreneurs are people of action, preferring to do what can be done than to talk about what might someday be.\n\n...Eventually It Builds Up and Explodes \u2013 That\u2019s My Idea\nSitting idle, especially in boredom, is the bane of Entrepreneurs\u2019 existence.\n\nExploration, excitement, adrenaline and risk \u2013 Entrepreneurs\u2019 friends should be prepared for all of these things. Often enough they\u2019re happy to perform for the crowd, but they also tend to encourage their friends to join in. Most personality types might take \u201cthanks but no thanks\u201d personally, but Entrepreneurs are comfortable with who they are, and are more likely to just shrug their shoulders and move on with those friends who are game for adventure.\n\n04"

Fun-loving and playful, flexible and understanding, people with the Entrepreneur personality type genuinely enjoy spending time with their children, and know how to make sure everyone is having a good time. Entrepreneurs have a natural curiosity and spontaneity that is perfectly matched to the wonder and insatiable desire to learn that young children have.\n\nLooking at Everything as if for the First Time\n\nEntrepreneurs love hands-on activities, and their children aren\u2019t left wanting for someone to play catch with, or to help them build a model for school. Sports, hiking, and other practical, hands-on hobbies are all welcomed and encouraged. At the same time, given their aversion to rules and schedules themselves, Entrepreneurs aren\u2019t likely to forcibly enter their children into all manner of clubs and teams. If their kids want to play softball, great \u2013 if not, well, they\u2019ll just find something else to do.\n\nMaybe the greatest thing about Entrepreneur parents is that they see their children as equal members of the family.\n\nEntrepreneurs give their children freedom, encourage them to use their own judgment (especially with the minor stuff), and to follow their hearts \u2013 to heck with what other people think. Entrepreneur personalities keep a close enough eye on their kids, using that knack for picking up on even the slightest changes in others\u2019 moods and habits, that they can step in with extra guidance when things start to go wrong.\n\nEntrepreneurs do have one significant parental challenge though: emotional bonding. Feelings tend to be seen by Entrepreneurs as a bit of an irrational distraction, rather than a tool for expression and connection. If their children happen to be more sensitive, this can be a source of tension between Entrepreneurs and their children. Frank honesty isn\u2019t always the best prescription.\n\nWe Are All Apprentices in a Craft Where No One Is Master\n\nStill, Entrepreneurs can often rely on a more sensitive partner to help them out in this regard, and the healthy bonds they form through their shared activities can help to bridge the gap. Entrepreneurs have the added benefit of direct and understanding relationships \u2013 their children won\u2019t feel so much like they have to hide their mistakes and challenges, the holy grail of parent-child communication.\n\n05"

At the same time, they\u2019re affable people who always seem to make friends and connections wherever they go. Popularity and solid networking can be huge assets in the working world, and Entrepreneurs nail it.\n\nThis social intelligence, combined with Entrepreneurs\u2019 natural boldness and improvisational skill, makes sales, business negotiations, marketing, even acting \u2013 any tense, competitive environment \u2013 a great fit. Entrepreneur personalities trust themselves to make the right call. Risks, big and small, are a part of life, and Entrepreneurs don\u2019t sit around waiting for some boss at the top to tell them what to do.

People with this personality type live life on their own terms, and this makes them brilliant business people and freelancers. These roles also allow them to delegate the more tedious aspects of work, the accounting, meticulous research and so forth, to those better suited.\n\nEntrepreneurs are curious, energetic people with a taste for action. There are those who analyze and manage the logistics of public safety resource distribution, and there are those who drive the ambulances, patrol the streets, and save lives with their own two hands \u2013 Entrepreneur personalities are the latter. They are highly observant yet impatient, enabling them to take in the whole of a situation at a glance, and act. Any emergency response role is great for Entrepreneurs, whether it be as paramedics, police officers, or soldiers.\n\nThere\u2019s Nothing to It \u2013 Just Sit Down and Bleed Your Passion\n\nThis quality of living in the moment and craving immediate results for their efforts translates well into another field: sports. The thrill of competition, of pushing themselves to the physical limit to rack up just one more point for the win can have no comparison for Entrepreneurs. Whether they are on the field as athletes themselves, coaching from the sidelines or commentating from high above, people with the Entrepreneur personality type revel in well-honed team effort and a well-executed plan, and any of these positions makes a fine line of work for them.\n\n06"

Naturally, some positions work better with these qualities than others, but Entrepreneurs are adaptable individuals, and can find a way to make just about any situation a little more interesting.\n\nEntrepreneur Subordinates\n\nEntrepreneurs\u2019 most challenging position is the one that most people have to start out in: as subordinates. While perfectly capable of exercising restraint on their own terms, Entrepreneur personalities hate having others\u2019 rules and regulations foisted upon them. Entrepreneurs are known for their experimentation, improvisation and quick thinking \u2013 if they\u2019re not allowed to use these qualities and have to check in with a supervisor for every little thing, they\u2019ll be bored and frustrated.\n\nEntrepreneurs know well that risk equals reward, and they\u2019ll gladly skirt more mundane tasks in favor of something a little more exciting, in the hope that it catches someone\u2019s attention. A plaque and a bonus go a long way for people with this personality type. Getting ahead by the tenets of staid reliability, quiet helpfulness, or mere seniority isn\u2019t Entrepreneurs\u2019 way \u2013 they move forward by sheer force of personality in a well-handled crisis.\n\nEntrepreneur Colleagues\n\nAs colleagues, Entrepreneurs have a work hard, play hard mentality \u2013 as long as everyone else is pulling their weight, they\u2019ll gladly pull their own, and have a great time doing it. Charming and popular individuals that they are, networking comes naturally to Entrepreneurs. These qualities make it easy for Entrepreneur personalities to get along with just about anyone.\n\nAt the same time, if Entrepreneurs see a colleague as incompetent, or worse, lazy, they let them know in no uncertain terms. Emotional sensitivity is not their strong suit. Entrepreneurs are very observant and well-tuned to changes in their colleagues\u2019 habits and moods \u2013 unless they themselves are the cause of distress.\n\nEntrepreneur Managers\n\nManagement positions are where Entrepreneurs are usually most comfortable, as they often give the most flexibility. Rules and traditions are a bother for people with the Entrepreneur personality type \u2013 they\u2019d rather try a bunch of new ideas with a chance of getting things done faster or better than to pay attention to \u201cthe way things have always been done\u201d or subordinates\u2019 comfort with experimentation. Entrepreneurs are practical, with a focus on what does, or could, work best.\n\nThis can make for a chaotic environment, but Entrepreneurs\u2019 inspiring cult of personality makes them well-suited to handling such a thing. Entrepreneurs enjoy living in the moment. Rather than some broad, intangible future accomplishment like \u201cmaking customers happy\u201d, Entrepreneur personalities set small, clear, measurable, and attainable goals that keep things on track day-to-day, and hearty congratulations can always be relied on for a job well done. Entrepreneurs keep their eyes on the finish line, but they get there step by step.\n\n07"

These people love vibrant experiences, engaging in life eagerly and taking pleasure in discovering the unknown. They can be very social, often encouraging others into shared activities.\n\nI\u2019m selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can\u2019t handle me at my worst, then you surely don\u2019t deserve me at my best.\n\nMARILYN MONROE\n\nIf anyone is to be found spontaneously breaking into song and dance, it is the Entertainer personality type. Entertainers get caught up in the excitement of the moment, and want everyone else to feel that way, too. No other personality type is as generous with their time and energy as Entertainers when it comes to encouraging others, and no other personality type does it with such irresistible style.\n\nWe Are All of Us Stars...\n\nEntertainers love the spotlight, and all the world\u2019s a stage. Many famous people with the Entertainer personality type are indeed actors, but they love putting on a show for their friends too, chatting with a unique and earthy wit, soaking up attention and making every outing feel a bit like a party. Utterly social, Entertainers enjoy the simplest things, and there\u2019s no greater joy for them than just having fun with a good group of friends.\n\nIt\u2019s not just talk either \u2013 Entertainers have the strongest aesthetic sense of any personality type. From grooming and outfits to a well-appointed home, Entertainer personalities have an eye for fashion. Knowing what\u2019s attractive the moment they see it, Entertainers aren\u2019t afraid to change their surroundings to reflect their personal style. Entertainers are naturally curious, exploring new designs and styles with ease.\n\nThough it may not always seem like it, Entertainers know that it\u2019s not all about them \u2013 they are observant, and very sensitive to others\u2019 emotions. People with this personality type are often the first to help someone talk out a challenging problem, happily providing emotional support and practical advice. However, if the problem is about them, Entertainers are more likely to avoid a conflict altogether than to address it head-on. Entertainers usually love a little drama and passion, but not so much when they are the focus of the criticisms it can bring.\n\n...And We Deserve to Twinkle\n\nThe biggest challenge Entertainers face is that they are often so focused on immediate pleasures that they neglect the duties and responsibilities that make those luxuries possible. Complex analysis, repetitive tasks, and matching statistics to real consequences are not easy activities for Entertainers. They\u2019d rather rely on luck or opportunity, or simply ask for help from their extensive circle of friends. It is important for Entertainers to challenge themselves to keep track of long-term things like their retirement plans or sugar intake \u2013 there won\u2019t always be someone else around who can help to keep an eye on these things.\n\nEntertainers recognize value and quality, which on its own is a fine trait. In combination with their tendency to be poor planners though, this can cause them to live beyond their means, and credit cards are especially dangerous. More focused on leaping at opportunities than in planning out long-term goals, Entertainers may find that their inattentiveness has made some activities unaffordable.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing that makes Entertainers feel quite as unhappy as realizing that they are boxed in by circumstance, unable to join their friends.\n\nEntertainers are welcome wherever there\u2019s a need for laughter, playfulness, and a volunteer to try something new and fun \u2013 and there\u2019s no greater joy for Entertainer personalities than to bring everyone else along for the ride. Entertainers can chat for hours, sometimes about anything but the topic they meant to talk about, and share their loved ones\u2019 emotions through good times and bad. If they can just remember to keep their ducks in a row, they\u2019ll always be ready to dive into all the new and exciting things the world has to offer, friends in tow.\n\n01",

Wanting to experience everything there is to experience, people with the Entertainer personality type don\u2019t mind stepping out of their comfort zones when no one else is willing.\nOriginal \u2013 Traditions and expectations are secondary to Entertainers, if a consideration at all. Entertainer personalities love to experiment with new styles, and constantly find new ways to stick out in the crowd.\nAesthetics and Showmanship \u2013 Not stopping at mere outfits, Entertainers inject artistic creativity into their words and actions, too. Every day is a performance, and Entertainers love to put on a show.\nPractical \u2013 To Entertainers, the world is meant to be felt and experienced. Truth is stranger than fiction, and Entertainers prefer to see and do than to wax philosophical about \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d.\nObservant \u2013 With all this focus on the here and now, on doing and acting, it makes sense that Entertainers are naturals when it comes to noticing real, tangible things and changes.\nExcellent People Skills \u2013 More so than things though, Entertainers love to pay attention to people. They are talkative, witty, and almost never run out of things to discuss. For people with this personality type, happiness and satisfaction stem from the time they spend with the people they enjoy being with.\nEntertainer Weaknesses\nSensitive \u2013 Entertainers (especially Turbulent ones) are strongly emotional, and very vulnerable to criticism \u2013 they can feel like they\u2019ve been backed into a corner, sometimes reacting badly. This is probably Entertainers\u2019 greatest weakness, because it makes it so hard to address any other weaknesses brought to light.\nConflict-Averse \u2013 Entertainers sometimes ignore and avoid conflict entirely. They tend to say and do what\u2019s needed to get out of such situations, then move on to something more fun.\nEasily Bored \u2013 Without constant excitement, Entertainers find ways to create it themselves. Risky behavior, self-indulgence, and the pleasures of the moment over long-term plans are all things Entertainers get into a little too often.\nPoor Long-Term Planners \u2013 In fact, Entertainer personalities rarely make detailed plans for the future. To them, things come as they come, and they rarely bother with taking the time to lay out steps and consequences, with the belief that they could change at any moment \u2013 even with things that can be planned.\nUnfocused \u2013 Anything that requires long-term dedication and focus is a particular challenge for Entertainers. In academics, dense, unchanging subjects like Classic Literature are much more difficult than more dynamic, relatable subjects like psychology. The trick for Entertainers is to find day-to-day joy in broader goals, and to tough it out with those tedious things that must be done.\n02"

                "content": "Romantic Relationships\n\nEntertainers are social, fun-loving, free-spirited people who live life in the moment and squeeze every little bit of excitement from everything. Naturally, they don\u2019t spare any of this freshness and energy when dating. For people with the Entertainer personality type, relationships aren\u2019t about slowly building foundations for the future, or planning out a life \u2013 they are bubbling, unpredictable things to be enjoyed for as long as there\u2019s enjoyment to be had.\n\nHere Today, Gone Tomorrow\n\nOf course, when that enjoyment does burn out, it\u2019s gone. Entertainers reevaluate their situations and commitments constantly, regardless of professions of love and dedication today. If a week later they just don\u2019t feel the same, that\u2019s it, and Entertainer personalities have no problem seriously considering breaking things off. While Entertainers can be willing to work on their relationships rather than swap them out, it takes a great deal of maturity and experience for them to realize that it can be worth the bother.\n\nWhile they do last though, relationships with Entertainers are simply unforgettable. People with this personality type always have some new and exciting activity up their sleeves, and they genuinely enjoy spending each moment with their partners. Entertainers enjoy physical intimacy immensely, and they prove themselves affectionate, inquisitive, and open-minded lovers who love to share pleasure with willing and reciprocative partners.\n\nConversation with Entertainers is similar, focusing on fun, sometimes quirky subjects rather than deep, soul-searching expressions. The past and the future, the sciences and politics, and long-term plans and commitments are all routinely ignored by Entertainer personalities. They slow things down and add too much weight to Entertainers\u2019 freewheeling style.\n\nEntertainers happily chat about just about anything or anyone that comes to mind, but won\u2019t have a topic forced.\n\nHighly emotional people, and sensitive, Entertainers respond poorly to outside \u201csuggestions\u201d on how to manage their love lives. They respond even worse if criticisms come from their partners, and trying to take emotions out of the picture by telling Entertainers to \u201cnot take this personally\u201d isn\u2019t helpful either. Handling these situations better is a definite area for improvement for Entertainers, as there are entire dating strategies (pretty distasteful, manipulative ones) that revolve around exploiting this very trait.\n\nOn the other hand, the issue can be a lack of criticism at all. Entertainers value social input a lot, and are almost as affected by their friends\u2019 opinions of their dating partners as their own. Since Entertainers are attracted to people who share their attitudes, whether dating partners or friends, this can leave them in an echo chamber that only tells them what they want to hear, reinforcing immature behaviors.\n\nJust Trying to Find Somebody to Love\n\nAll of these tendencies can really come back to haunt people with the Entertainer personality type later on. Entertainers\u2019 tendency to avoid promises and commitments and jump from partner to partner sabotages necessary long-term goals like retirement planning. Building real relationships takes time and conscious effort.\n\nLuckily, Entertainers are incredibly likeable people who enjoy life\u2019s small pleasures, and hardly want for diversity in their partners. Enthusiastic and affectionate, with a pure and down-to-earth love that just takes things at face value, Entertainers are fortunate that they take the time to find someone they truly enjoy being with every day, rather than settling too soon for stability over happiness, only to lose both.\n\n03"

They don\u2019t internalize much of anything, sharing it all with their extensive circles of friends with wit, style, enthusiasm, and optimism. Entertainers are explorers of the pleasures of life, and they take particular pleasure in sharing those experiences with others. For Entertainers, there\u2019s no point in living if you can\u2019t feel alive.\n\nBetter Be Totally Ridiculous Than Totally Boring\n\nEntertainers are people of action. Getting out with activities that engage all five senses is Entertainer personalities\u2019 idea of a good time. Sometimes though, Entertainers may go too far with risky or careless behaviors, and try to bring others along for the ride. People with this personality type are sensitive, and rejecting these pastimes can be taken personally, ending friendships then and there. Entertainers don\u2019t have time to be lectured.\n\nMaking new friends isn\u2019t a problem for Entertainers though \u2013 they use an alluring combination of blunt truths and disarming openness and charm to keep things moving. Where Entertainer personalities falter is in keeping the friends they already have. In their excitement and focus on here and now over history, Entertainers too easily exhaust the adventure one person has to offer, moving on once one person\u2019s novelty has worn off.\n\nThis can all give the impression that Entertainers are shallow, pleasure-centric creatures who care little for anyone but themselves. This is a terrible misunderstanding, and far from the truth, but nevertheless makes friendships with Intuitive (N) personality types challenging. Entertainers care sincerely about their friends \u2013 it\u2019s why they put so much effort into coming up with group experiences they believe everyone will enjoy \u2013 and they are deeply distressed by the occasional conflicts that end these relationships.\n\nAs they grow and mature, Entertainers respect different personality types and approaches more and more.\n\nNovelty is king for people with the Entertainer personality type, and there\u2019s only so much diversity among fellow Explorer types. Entertainers love touching on intellectual and philosophical subjects, and they seek out a diversity of personality types and perspectives to keep among their friends. But as these friends grind into the details of some esoteric topic about the long-term consequences of faltering European economic output, Entertainers inevitably find their minds wandering, hoping for someone to rush up and say \u201cGuess what just happened!\u201d\n\n04"

Playing with children is a genuine pleasure for them, and people with the Entertainer personality type constantly devise new and exciting ways to enjoy their time with their children. From the first moment they hold their babies, Entertainers are taken with the joy and wonder that their children experience in everything around them, and share and encourage it as much as possible.\n\nThey Who Are Brave Are Free\n\nExploration and experiences are key philosophies for Entertainer parents \u2013 when their children ask questions, the answer is \u201cLet\u2019s find out!\u201d Overbearing structures and tightly scheduled activities aren\u2019t a big part of Entertainer personalities\u2019 parenting. They\u2019d much rather take things day by day and break up the crust by letting their children explore something new in their own way, something much appreciated by Entertainers\u2019 children.\n\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t any rules \u2013 Entertainers were young once, too!\n\nDiscipline is far from their strongest suit, but hindsight and maturity have their effects, and Entertainers are often keen to prevent their children from suffering the same hurts and setbacks they themselves experienced. People with the Entertainer personality type are quite sensitive themselves, and expect their children to be respectful and considerate with what rules there are, a point of contention through the teenage years.\n\nEntertainers always keep up their end of the bargain though, providing plenty of emotional support. While not especially demanding parents, warm affection and a sense of practicality give Entertainer personalities a very nurturing and encouraging parenting style, filling the gap nicely. When their children declare themselves future astronauts, Entertainers happily build make-believe spaceships, and later use those declarations to help their children focus on their schoolwork and goals. After all, successful astronauts need to know their math!\n\n05"

When people with the Entertainer personality type are at a party or concert, they reflect that mood, giving them that \u201cparty people\u201d image. When their friends are sad, they mirror that with sympathy and empathy. And when there is a crisis, Entertainers adapt as well, matching the intensity of the situation.\n\nTrying to Find Yourself...\n\nAs a result, just about any career that focuses on working with others is a good fit, and is even essential for Entertainers to be happy and productive. Entertainer personalities are natural event planners, sales representatives, trip planners, and tour guides, as each of these creates a sense of excitement, stimulation, and novelty between them and their customers.\n\nEntertainers balance their emotional sensitivity with a strong sense of independence and resourcefulness, making each experience unique.\n\nEntertainers genuinely enjoy spending time with others and getting to know them, and have a knack for making people happy, even in the most frustrating situations. A good challenge is always appreciated by Entertainer personalities, and they make wonderful and inspiring counselors, social workers, personal coaches, and consultants who improve employee or customer satisfaction.\n\nWith their ability to respond with resourcefulness and passion when their help is badly needed, Entertainers make brilliant medical professionals, especially as EMTs, paramedics, and nurses. They quickly pick up information about others, helping them get straight to the heart of the issue when dealing with the sick or injured. Entertainers thrive on intense emotion, and there\u2019s hardly a better place for it.\n\nNot everybody has the energy for that though, or wants the responsibility of life and death \u2013 some Entertainers prefer to make people happy and excited by creating beauty instead. People with this personality type have plenty of creative energy, and many build fulfilling careers in music, fashion, photography, and interior design. With the best aesthetic sense of any personality type, Entertainers are renowned for their sense of style.\n\n...Isn\u2019t Always Easy\n\nHowever, jobs that eliminate human contact and focus on impartial, data-driven decisions are torturous to Entertainers. Some Entertainer personalities do well enough by blowing off steam with friends after work, but for the most part, careers like technical writing or data analysis are poor fits. Add Entertainers\u2019 loathing for schedules, structures, and repetition, and nine-to-five administrative work is quickly sent to the \u201cnope\u201d bin.\n\nRegardless of where their diverse passions lie, Entertainers need freedom, novelty, and above all, human contact. People with the Entertainer personality type need to know that they aren\u2019t just appreciated, though that is very important, but liked. When Entertainers come in to work, they want to see a touch of chaos, and to navigate it with a crack team of capable friends who are all too happy to take action by their sides.\n\n06"

People with the Entertainer personality type are able to take a social and relaxed attitude and use it to get everyone else on board with practical tasks that just need to get done. The more freedom Entertainers have to meet these needs, the better the results, so long as they know what the goal is, and there\u2019s hardly a better personality type to have around in a dynamic, hectic work environment.\n\nEntertainer Subordinates\n\nAs subordinates, Entertainers thrive on change and new ideas, and loathe repetitive and strictly defined tasks. Entertainer personalities\u2019 managers find willing and able experimenters who can brainstorm, quickly grasp new methods, and actually put those methods to practical use \u2013 so long as Entertainers have a little leeway apply their own creative style. Changes may take a few tries though, as Entertainers can be forgetful in the heat of the moment, and can get more caught up in trying to get quick returns.\n\nEntertainers give honest feedback on whether things make sense, but are quite sensitive to others\u2019 criticism of their own habits. Under fire, people with this personality type (especially Turbulent ones) become defensive and are easily upset. But in the end, if they believe that the criticism comes from an honest intent to help, not hurt, Entertainers take it to heart. The biggest struggle for Entertainers in subordinate positions is that they value freedom and independence far more than safety and security \u2013 if their conditions aren\u2019t met, they\u2019re as likely to leave as make do.\n\nEntertainer Colleagues\n\nIf anyone can make friends with their colleagues and keep tension at bay within their team, it\u2019s Entertainers. A fun atmosphere is important, and people with the Entertainer personality type use their strong observational and social skills to bring everyone together, shifting a souring mood if need be. Entertainers rarely want for ideas on how to make this happen, happily organizing events and activities inside and outside the workplace. Entertainers\u2019 spontaneity, wit, and enthusiasm have no equal.\n\nEntertainer Managers\n\nAs managers, Entertainers do everything they can to pump energy and fun into the day-to-day work that needs to be done. Entertainer personalities enjoy being the center of attention, and even more so to feel like they\u2019re needed and appreciated. Jumping into the thick of the work and applying themselves to anything they\u2019d ask their subordinates to do is something Entertainers consider part of the job. Authority and social status are secondary to feeling like they\u2019re an important part of a team that gets the job done.\n\nEntertainers are great at noticing others\u2019 moods, and there are few personality types better at preventing conflict and encouraging relaxed, enjoyable workplaces. Subordinates are always welcome to speak their minds, and people with this personality type are always happy to hear others out, especially if something is upsetting them.
